How much does joining FSL cost?  What about meals?  What about moving into the chapter house?  Who do I turn to if I have a concern?  More questions? \nWhat are the requirements to join? \nEach fraternity and sorority has different membership criteria. Oftentimes, these include some sort of GPA minimum requirement or academic expectation. Students are encouraged to speak with members about these requirements during the recruitment process.\n[FSL Requirements ](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsl/parents/faq.html \"View FSL requirements\")\nThe financial commitment for joining a fraternity or sorority varies depending on each chapter and council. The fraternities and sororities each have their own dues, ranging from $100.00 to $5,500.00 a semester. It is helpful to note that the first semester of membership tends to be the most expensive.\n[COST](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsl/parents/faq.html \"Learn more about the cost of FSL\")\nIf your chapter is housed and has a kitchen, after recruitment you will have the opportunity to alter your meal plan with Residence Life and Dining. Depending on the chapter, meals may be provided daily or weekly. If you live in the house in the future, meals are included as part of the fees.\n[MEALS & DUES INFORMATION](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsl/parents/faq.html \"View meals and dues information\")\nNot all chapters are housed. But, if your fraternity or sorority is housed, students generally do not move in immediately. Members will still participate in all events and be fully included in FSL activities but will live in the dorms or their previous living arrangements. Members can move into the chapter house in their second year.\n[FSL Housing](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsl/aboutus/housing.html \"Learn more about FSL housing\")\nThe FSL community works hard to make sure each member feels safe and supported. Please, reach out with any concerns if you feel this is not the case. Concerns can be reported via a UW Cares form. These reports are not intended for emergencies but can be filled out by students or parents who would like to express a concern. These forms are looked over and addressed by a multidisciplinary UW team.\n[UW Cares Form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofWyoming&layout_id=5 \"Link to the UW Cares Form\")\nExplore our full FAQ page to get all your questions answered!\n[FSL FAQs](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsl/parents/faq.html \"View more F.A.Q.'s\")\nWhat are the requirements to join? \n### We Have Answers!\nWhat are the requirements to join?

Whether you're staying overnight or just visiting for the day, we’ve got everything you need to plan your trip.\n[Plan Your Visit](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/visit/plan-your-visit.html)\n## New Student Day Checklist \nTo ensure you’re fully prepared for New Student Days, follow this checklist and complete each task before attending. Remember you must register for a New Student Day date in advance! \nConfirm Your Enrollment \n[Confirm your enrollment](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/nextsteps.html#confirm) before attending New Student Days to ensure you're able to meet with academic advisors and register for your fall classes. If UW is your #1 choice, we encourage you to confirm as soon as possible so you can complete your registration during the event.\nVerify Your Major \nYou can view your major under your name when you initially log in to your WyoRecords checklist. Contact admissions at least a week before your New Student Day event if you need to update your major. If you are interested in double majoring or adding a minor, you do not need to do anything now. You can discuss this with your advisor this summer or fall.\nTake the Math Placement Exam \nIf you have not taken the ACT/SAT, we recommend taking the [Math Placement Exam](https://www.uwyo.edu/mathstats/math-placement/index.html) at least four days prior to your New Student Day event to help your advisor recommend an appropriate math class.\nLook to your WyoWeb checklist to determine your status \n  * Red exclamation mark - we need you to take the exam.\n  * Green check mark - you do not need to take the placement exam.\n  * Yellow triangle - you should discuss with your advisor the options for your math course.\n\n\nSubmit Your ACT/SAT Scores to Admissions \nEven though ACT/SAT scores are not required for admission, they are helpful for math class placement. If you haven't yet sent us your ACT/SAT results, please have them sent to UW Admissions through your testing agency. You can also email a copy of your ACT/SAT score report to UW Admissions. Please be sure it has your first and last name on it, includes the test date, and the score breakdown for each exam section.\nSubmit Proof of MMR Immunization \n[Submit proof of your MMR immunizations](https://www.uwyo.edu/shser/mmr-requirement.html) (measles, mumps, rubella) through the Student Health Service Online Patient Portal. This step must be completed before you can register for classes. Make sure to submit your records as soon as possible to avoid any delays.\nComplete Your Housing Application \nFill out your housing application through your WyoRecords account, including your [Living Learning Community (LLC)](https://www.uwyo.edu/figs/index.html) interest and select your meal plan.\nComplete the Prepare for Registration Checklist \nComplete the [Prepare for Registration checklist](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/_files/docs/events/new-student-day/prepare-registratoin-checklist-instructions.pdf) through your WyoRecords account by clicking on Register for Classes on the first two screens and complete all steps with a yellow triangle. \nNOTE: This is different than your WyoWeb checklist when you initially login. This includes the following:\n  * Opting in/out of UW health insurance coverage\n  * Providing a UW Alert Cell Phone number\n  * Updating contact information\n  * Completing the Student Financial Responsibility Agreement\n\n\nCheck your UW Email Regularly \nPlease check your email regularly (including spam/junk/clutter folders) for important information about not only New Student Day but other important things leading up to your start at UW this fall.\nIf you initially applied to UW with your high school email address, please let us know a personal email (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) so we can update your account. We don’t want you to miss important emails that get caught in the spam filter or when your email gets shut off after graduation.\nDownload the Navigate Student App \nDownload the [Navigate Student app](https://www.uwyo.edu/navigate/index.html) by EAB Global and use your UW login information to access your account.\n## Contact Us\n### UW Campus Visitor Center\nRoss Hall\n  * 1000 E.

Our campus is tucked right in at the base of the Snowy Mountains and is full of exciting things to do! Of course, we recommend grabbing a beverage or snack at our [on-campus coffee shops](https://www.uwyo.edu/living/dining/dining-hours.html) or playing a game of billiards at the [Pokes Pub & Gameroom](https://www.uwyo.edu/union/pokes-pub-and-gameroom/index.html), but Laramie has so much to offer!  \n  \nBe sure to explore our bustling downtown ([voted one of the top 3 main streets in the nation!](https://mainstreet.org/our-network/awards-and-recognition/great-american-main-street-awards/laramie-wyoming)) and maybe even get in a little outdoor recreation at our many nearby forest and mountain areas. Discover all the reasons the locals call Laramie, Laradise.\n[Visit Laramie](https://www.uwyo.edu/uw/aboutuw/about-laramie.html)\n## What to Bring for Your Visit to Laramie\n[Laramie weather](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/b5f629e4a418e4bb39b77f5f1206ae1a2c0748e25d00b770198262f0d75f415e) can be a bit unpredictable, so it’s best to dress in layers. In winter, be ready for snow, while summer is likely to bring some sun—don’t forget sunscreen and a water bottle! Comfortable shoes are a must, especially for walking around campus. It’s always a good idea to check the weather the day before your visit so you can pack accordingly and make the most of your time on campus.\n[Laramie Conditions](https://wyoroad.info/pls/Browse/WRR.TownResults?SelectedTown=Laramie)\n## Contact Us\n### UW Campus Visitor Center\nRoss Hall\n  * 1000 E.

        "url_53": "# Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing (AIM)\nAdvanced materials and manufacturing are important pillars and drivers of today’s economy. They have made consumer devices like TVs and computers ubiquitous by enabling cheap mass production of reliable products, and enabled industrial applications on a scale not seen before. However, designing new materials is a slow and laborious process, requiring significant investments in capital and labor.\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence allow to improve and speed up this process. In particular, machine learning techniques can replace expensive and time-consuming laboratory processes and computational simulations to quickly and reliably predict how to create materials with desired properties and how materials will behave in specific circumstances. So-called surrogate models learn how properties of materials and experimental parameters relate to experimental results.\nAIM applies these techniques to materials engineering and manufacturing to reduce cost and improve performance. The center merges synergistic expertise at the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences in materials development, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science for the development of powerful methods to design and model the behavior of advanced materials and manufacture advanced devices.\nNavigation [ Main Page ](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps)\n[Funding Opportunities](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/engineering-initiative/engineering-initiative-funding-opportunities.html)\n[Undergrad Engineering Scholars ](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/engineering-initiative/undergraduate-scholars.html)\n[Research Centers of Excellence](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/engineering-initiative/research-centers-of-excellence.html)\n[Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/engineering-initiative/aim.html)\n[Our Facilities](https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/engineering-initiative/facilities.html)\n## Projects\n### Graphene Oxide Film Graphitization via Laser Patterning\nGraphene oxide can be treated with lasers to create patterns of conducting carbon within a surrounding environment of insulating materials. This allows to create nano-scale circuits in thin sheets of materials, enabling next-generation devices. Laser patterning is a complex process that requires precise real-time control to achieve the desired results. We apply techniques from artificial intelligence to achieve the necessary precise control.\nComposite Failure Prediction\nDetermining the limits of forces that can be applied to composite materials before they break is an important problem in engineering and manufacturing. The field has developed a number of failure criteria, which allow to describe those limits in a closed functional form, so called failure envelopes. However, these functional forms are not very flexible, and require significant experimentation with new materials to be determined. We apply machine learning techniques for more flexible failure envelopes and to predict them based on very little data for new materials.\nNature-Inspired Impact-Resistant Materials\nComposite microstructures observed in nature serve as templates for the development of new synthetic materials. However, it has proven difficult to reproduce the properties found in natural materials due to the interaction of intricate structures at varying length scales. Rather than attempting to replicate these materials (biomimetics), the focus of this work is to use a bio-inspired pattern generation algorithm (the Gray-Scott model), optimized by Bayesian methods from Artificial Intelligence, to design new materials with high energy absorption properties.\nActivites\nAIM Center Awarded NASA Grant for Manufacturing Flexible Electronics\nCenter PIs Johnson, Kotthoff, and Aidhy have been awarded a $750,000 grant from NASA EPSCoR to investigate ways of manufacturing flexbile electronics in space. The grant builds on expertise developed in the center on combining machine learning with advanced materials and manufacturing and will see the PIs collaborate with researchers at NASA Ames over three years to develop approaches for manufacturing electronics with low power and resource requirements that can be used for example aboard the International Space Station.\nMore information is available in a UW press release. The grant was also covered in an NPR news item.\nAIM workshop at Materials Science and Engineering Symposium\nThe AIM center organized a workshop on AI and advanced manufacturing, co-located with the 2019 University of Wyoming Materials Science and Engineering Symposium. Invited speakers included David Estrada (Boise State University) and Kamal Choudhary (National Institute of Standards and Technology). In addition, AIM PIs and associated researchers presented the latest results on applying state-of-the-art AI to laser-induced graphene production, atomistic modeling, and porous media modeling.\nThe workshop featured a hands-on session where participants were able to use state-of-the-art machine learning modeling to optimize manufacturing processes themselves, based on real data and approaches developed by the center PIs. This was the first exposure to AI techniques for many of the approximately 25 participants, giving them an idea of the power of the approach and how to apply it in their own research.\n## Publications\n  * Wahab, Hud, Vivek Jain, Alexander Scott Tyrrell, Michael Alan Seas, Lars Kotthoff, and Patrick Alfred Johnson. \"Machine-Learning-Assisted Fabrication: Bayesian Optimization of Laser-Induced Graphene Patterning Using in-Situ Raman Analysis.\" Carbon 167 (2020): 609–19. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2020.05.087>.

The two-plus-two agreement will facilitate the transfer of NAIT students to UW after two years of study at their home institution in Edmonton to complete their Bachelor of Science degrees within another two to two-and-a-half years of study. (Douglas Cuthbertson Photo)\nThe University of Wyoming Department of Energy and Petroleum Engineering recently entered into a five-year articulation agreement with the School of Energy and Natural Resources at Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT).   \n  \n\nThe two-plus-two agreement will facilitate the transfer of NAIT students to UW after two years of study at their home institution in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, to complete their Bachelor of Science degrees within another two to two-and-a-half years of study.  \n  \n\nWhile the current agreement, signed Nov. 5, is specific to the petroleum engineering programs at each institution, NAIT is excited about potential future two-plus-two agreements to facilitate the transfer of students into chemical engineering, electrical engineering and other degree programs at UW.  \n  \n\nAgatha Ojimelukwe, dean of NAIT’s School of Energy and Natural Resources, is thrilled about the potential of the new partnership with UW.   \n  \n\n“This collaboration not only enhances educational opportunities for our graduates but also strengthens the North American Energy Corridor, facilitating a more seamless movement of talent,” Ojimelukwe says.  \n  \n\nDanny Dale, interim dean of the UW College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, and Soheil Saraji, a UW associate professor of energy and petroleum engineering, both traveled to NAIT in Edmonton to ratify the agreement during a signing ceremony with Ojimelukwe. Douglas Cuthbertson, external relations for the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences, and Tate Noble, assistant director of development at the UW Foundation, also were part of the UW delegation in attendance.  \n  \n\n“This agreement is good for the vibrancy of our petroleum engineering program at UW, is important for the state of Wyoming, and contributes to the overall economic benefit of both the U.S. and Canada,” Dale says. “The industry needs more petroleum engineers in the field, and this partnership will help fill that need.”  \n  \n\nSimilar agreements are in place or in the works between the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences and other institutions as well, including Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT), Canisius University in Buffalo, N.Y., and Aims Community College in Greeley, Colo.  \n  \n\nTo facilitate foreign study in the U.S., the Eresman Family Engineering Endowment at UW provides funds for scholarships that give preference to NAIT and SAIT graduates transferring into the Department of Energy and Petroleum Engineering.  \n  \n\nUW has long welcomed students from both NAIT and SAIT. Their curricula provide an eminently strong foundation in technical skills and applied experience. Students from the institutions have traditionally been very successful at UW, which provides a cost-effective route to a high-quality advanced degree. The current agreement formalizes what has been a highly successful relationship between the institutions over the years.  \n  \n\n“This partnership reflects our shared commitment to expanding educational access and preparing students with the technical and problem-solving skills needed to lead in an evolving energy landscape,” Saraji says. “By connecting Alberta’s applied expertise with Wyoming’s advanced engineering education, we’re helping strengthen the energy workforce across the Rocky Mountain region.”   \n  \n  \n\n## Contact Us\n### Institutional Communications Department\nBureau of Mines Building\n  * Room 137\n  * 1000 E.

The unambiguous goal of the Tier 1 Engineering Initiative is to elevate UW’s CEPS to national prominence in undergraduate education and selected areas of research, and to enhance economic development in Wyoming. To this end, the implementation plan of the initiative focuses on the following strategic goals:\n  1. **Excellence in Undergraduate Education** : The College of Engineering and Physical Sciences has solid educational programs that produce talented graduates, who are in demand by employers. Our goal is to enhance these programs and expand our local recognition to a national reputation.\n  2. **World-Class Research and Graduate Education:** Research leading to discovery and innovation often happens at the interface of different disciplines, where ideas and talents intersect to solve pressing problems. We seek to build world-class interdisciplinary research capabilities in selected areas that will have significant impact on Wyoming and the nation and enrich student mentoring.\n  3. **Productive Economic Development through Partnerships:**\n  4. **K-14 STEM Education:** Strength in K-14 education can enhance the quality and quantity of students who pursue STEM programs at UW and ultimately pursue high-impact careers in the State. We will introduce STEM concepts early in the K-12 educational experience, and we will also enrich the STEM skill sets of UW’s freshmen and sophomore students to improve performance and retention.\n\n\n**Outcomes**. The outcomes of this investment will be transformative. By the completion of Phase 3 in **2025** , the CEAS will:\n  * Increase undergraduate enrollment from 1,400 to 2,200\n  * Increase graduate enrollment to 560\n  * Double the number of financial awards and scholarships\n  * Establish research centers of excellence in at least six critical areas of engineering and applied science consistent with creating economic impact to the state\n\n\nWyoming state government has made a significant investment in a historic initiative to propel UW to the realms of excellence.

We are confident that you will be more prepared to find a career that suits your passions,values, interests, and goals.\nFIRST YEAR: REFLECT AND EXPLORE\n| \n  * Nail down a system for yourself to complete courses successfully. This may include dedicating the right amount of time to study, people to study with, and places to complete coursework.\n  * Check your UWYO email regularly. This is a valuable place for you to learn about upcoming jobs and events like the UW Career Fair!\n  * Complete the Cowboy Joe Exercise (Flower Exercise). This is an effective way to reflect on your own interests, skills, and values, and do some research on the field you eventually want to get into.\n  * Join a registered student organization (RSO). Student organizations will allow you to meet other students and may even help you develop professionally and build connections in the industry.\n  * Login to Handshake and attend the UW Career Fair. Events like the UW Career Fair and company information sessions are extremely valuable for learning about opportunities and building relationships.\n  * Build (or update) your resume and meet with a Career Services Professional. In this meeting, you may talk about anything internship or professional development related, though the focus of this meeting may be to simply go over your resume, talk about job searching in general, and briefly discuss your personal 4-year plan!\n\n  \n---|---  \nSECOND YEAR: PREPARE\n| \n  * Meet with a Career Services Professional to talk about tailoring your resume and/or cover letter, interviewing, and start applying for internships or Research Undergraduate Experiences (REUs). Many second-year students obtain relevant summer work. This is a great time to start to use what you're learning in class in a real-world situation. If you are looking to apply, start early! Positions open and close throughout the school year, many as early as September.\n  * Dive into Suitable (SOAR) to upskill and learn more about career competencies. SOAR has information as well as lessons for you to learn about essential skills that will be helpful with entering the workforce.\n  * Dive into the career resources below. We have resources for everything from resumes to job searching links available to you. Take a look and determine what you need to be successful.\n  * Attend career events and start growing your network. Attend events like the UW Career Fair, career seminars, and company presentations to build connections you may use as you actively apply for positions.\n  * Create a LinkedIn profile to connect with professionals. LinkedIn is a professional social media tool for networking and it can be valuable when trying to keep in touch with professionals in the field\n\n  \n---|---  \nTHIRD YEAR: EXPERIENCE\n| \n  * Research graduate education to determine if that is right for you. Graduate school will give you a deeper understanding of your subject and will likely give you experience in research. Grad school may be a requirement for the field you are looking to get into.\n  * Get an internship or get involved in research. Start your search early and reach out to our Career Services Professionals for assistance.\n  * Take on a leadership role with your RSO. You can elaborate on this in your resume to show the skills you have gained and the initiative you have taken.\n  * Perform informational interviews with your contacts. Informational interviewing is when you ask a professional to meet in order for you to ask them a few professional questions. This can help you learn more about your career field and strengthen your connection.\n\n  \n---|---  \nFOURTH YEAR: SUCCEED\n| \n  * Start applying for jobs early. It can take anywhere from 3-to-12 months to get a job once you start applying. We generally recommend that seniors use multiple job searching boards and strategies and start applying for positions 3-to-7 months before they graduate.\n  * Meet with our CEPS Career Services Office to learn about salary negotiation techniques.\n  * Let your professional contacts know that you are looking for a job and let them know when you apply. This is a major benefit to having a professional network. Professionals know about available roles and may be able to help you get your foot in the door!\n  * Complete your First Destination Survey before you graduate. This information gives us a good idea about where our students are going and how much they are making.\n\n  \n---|---  \nMASTERS AND PHD STUDENTS\n  * Meet with a Career Services Professional to talk about your goals and experience. Our CEPS Career Services staff can help you format research experience, projects, publications and any other items that you may want to include on your resume or CV.\n  * Tailor your job search for positions that you are interested in and qualified for. This may look slightly different for master's students looking to get involved in research!\n\n\n### CEPS CAREER RESOURCES\nBeneficial resources to guide you to your professional goals.

Boyer. He is the author and maintainer of the ACL2(r) variant of the theorem prover ACL2, and he is recognized as an expert in the formalization of mathematics with ACL2. His interests are very broad, encompassing almost all aspects of computer science. Beyond that, he has a lifelong love of mathematics, physics, and astronomy. In fact, he is an amateur astronomer who dabbles in astrophotography. He is also a passionate educator and a strong believer in the power of education to change people’s lives for the better. As part of his educational mission, he serves as the ABET coordinator for the Computer Science program at UW, and he is a member of ABET's Computing Accreditation Commision. \nResearch Interests\n  * ACL2, formalization of mathematics, automated theorem proving, applications of cloud computing and NoSQL databases\n\n\n  \nProfessional Experience\n  * Professor, University of Wyoming, 2015-present\n  * Associate Professor, University of Wyoming, 2007-2015\n  * Assistant Professor, University of Wyoming, 2002-2007\n  * Member, Technical Advisory Group, Morningstar, 2010-2011\n  * Member, Technical Advisory Board, Logical Information Machines (LIM), 2000-2010\n  * V.P. of Engineering, Loop One, 2000-2001\n  * Founder and Member of Board of Directors, Logical Information Machines (LIM), 1990-2000\n  * Junior Member, Technical Staff, Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), 1988-1989\n\n\n  \nCurrent Research Projects\n  * Continuing the ACL2(r) formalization of the transcendental functions in the x86 instruction set. This project is motivated by work of David Russinoff originally at AMD and now at Intel.\n  * Continuing the formalization of various sequences and series in ACL2(r). Of particular interest are the convergence and divergence of summations of reciprocals of various sets of numbers, e.g., primes.\n  * Proving Lindemann’s theorem and the transcendence of e and π in ACL2(r). This project is in support of a practical verification effort at Intel.\n  * Exploring the formalization of analog circuits in ACL2(r). This project is of interest to engineers at Centaur Technology, who use formal methods to reason about digital designs and would like a similar support for analog design.\n\n\nNavigation [ Main Page ](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs)\nFaculty & Staff\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/index.html)[Faculty & Staff](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/index.html)[Graduate Students](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/gradstudents/index.html)[Emeritus & Adjunct Faculty](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/adjunct-and-emeritus/index.html)\nFaculty Research\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/research/index.html)[Department Research](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/research/index.html)[EECS Faculty Directory](https://www.uwyo.edu/eecs/faculty-staff/index.html)\n## Contact Us\n### Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nEngineering Building\n  * Room 5068\n  * 1000 E.

        "url_212": "# NCAR Wyoming Supercomputing Center\n## Overview\nThe NCAR Wyoming Supercomputing Center ([NWSC](http://nwsc.ucar.edu \"NWSC\")) represents a collaboration between NCAR and the University of Wyoming. Through the Wyoming-NCAR Alliance (WNA), 320 million core hours of the [Derecho System](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74317833), is available for Wyoming-led projects in the atmospheric, earth system, geological, anny NSF supported sciences and Science areas of interest to Wyoming. Large allocations are overseen by the WNA Resource Advisory Panel ([WRAP](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/WRAP/index.html \"Wyoming-NCAR Resource Advisory Panel\")) and Large Computation Allocation Panel (LCAP); a University of Wyoming-managed process. \nIn addition, allocations may be given to support faculty’s integration of high performance computing in their undergraduate and graduate courses, and to support initial code development, experimentation, application testing and data analysis to be used to strengthen a future grant proposal. Resources may also be made available to a small number of projects funded by other government agencies or by the private sector.\nTo access the NWSC supercomputers, storage systems and data analysis and visualization resources, users must apply for allocations. Applications are reviewed and time is allocated according to the merit and needs of the projects and the availability of resources.\nWNA Allocation Basics\n  * Project-based. Allocations for UW’s portion of NWSC resources are allocated through project that has a single principal investigator (PI), and may include allocations to one or more resources (e.g. compute time, high-performance storage, data acquisition and visualization). The PI uses the same project to request or renew an allocation, as the focus and computational activities evolve throughout the process.\n  * Usage metric. The core-hour is the basic unit to measure and track the usage of NWSC resources (including the NWSC supercomputers, high-performance storage system, data analysis and visualization systems). \n  * Eligibility. All University of Wyoming faculty are eligible to apply for an allocation. Large Allocations must be explicitly linked to funded, peer-reviewed research projects in atmospheric, earth system, geological and related sciences ([list of approved areas](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/Eligibility/science_areas.html \"Eligible Science Areas\")). An allocation request from a UW researcher can include allocations for collaborating researchers from other US institutions who are PIs or senior personnel in the funded project. Large Allocation requests will be evaluated semi-annually by the WNA Resource Advisory Panel (WRAP).\n  * Small allocations. UW graduate students and post-docs, and UW faculty working towards creating data, testing algorithms, etc., for a future grant proposal are eligible to apply for a start-up allocation. No panel review is needed for small allocation requests, and such requests can usually be accommodated within a few business days. Small allocation requests can be made at any time using the online form available by selecting the Small Allocation Form tab on the left. \n  * Educational allocations. NWSC encourages the use of high-performance computing in undergraduate and graduate courses at UW or Wyoming Community colleges and accounts can be provided to individual students and the instructor for assignments involving numerical simulations, modeling, and use of recently developed computational architecture. Faculty needing to use a NWSC resource for an undergraduate or graduate course they are teaching should send e-mail to wrap@uwyo.edu describing the anticipated software needs, storage and computing usage at least two weeks prior to the start of the semester the course is taught. If the anticipated usage is more than 100,000 core-hours for the class, then WNA will want an extended abstract describing how the resource estimate was calculated. If anticipated usage for the class is more than 400,000 core-hours, then a large allocation request must be submitted for WRAP review.\n  * Duration. Research project and small allocations are for one year. Educational allocations are for the duration of the related class.\n\n\n[Download ](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/_files/AllocationTips.pdf \"AllocationTips\")slides about the allocation basics and advice on preparing a request. \nNWSC Upgrade Information\n  * [Derecho Upgrade](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/_files/derecho.pdf)\n\n\nDerecho Roadshow Presentations\n  * [Hardware and Software Resources](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/_files/2023-derecho-overview-resources.pdf \"Derecho Resources\")\n  * [User Training](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/_files/2023-derecho-uwyo-training.pdf)\n  * [Roadshow Recording](https://uwyo.zoom.us/rec/share/zSbIACOKe6MlzNLbAO3GgoRDyBwlTaZjgYc4qNyyLJXQjDsFNArpAP9l7vrN-aXw.C-z3hQfKBmjNmyYJ \"Roadshow Video\")\n\n\nNavigation [ Main Page ](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc)\nResearch Computing at UW\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/research-computing/index.html)\n[User Support and Consulting](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/User%20support%20and%20consulting.html)\nAllocation Info\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/allocations/index.html)[Large Allocations](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/allocations/large_allocations.html)[Small Allocations](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/allocations/small_allocations.html)\nResearchers with NWSC Interests\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/uwresearchers/index.html)\nWNA Resource Advisory Panel\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/WRAP/index.html)[Conflicts of Interest](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/WRAP/Conflicts.html)\n[Visitor Center](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/VisitorCenter.html)\nEligibility\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/Eligibility/index.html)[Eligible Science Areas](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/Eligibility/science_areas.html)[Evaluation Criteria](https://www.uwyo.edu/nwsc/Eligibility/WRAP_Criteria.html)\n## Contact Us\n### Research and Economic Development Division\n  * 1000 E.

If you come across any information not covered on this page, please forward it to fgraf@uwyo.edu for inclusion.\n# Federal Funding Changes/Updates\n**_Updated as of 9/22/2025_**\nThe U.S. federal government faces the possibility of a **shutdown on October 1, 2025** , the first day of the new federal fiscal year, if Congress does not reach an agreement on a continuing resolution (CR) or full-year appropriations. While negotiations continue, no final action has been taken. If a shutdown occurs, each federal agency will implement its own contingency plan, including determinations of “essential personnel” and how ongoing grants and contracts are managed. Projects should continue unless you are specifically advised otherwise by your federal program officer or sponsor.  \n[Recommended steps](https://www.uwyo.edu/research/_files/_docs/potential-government-shutdown-guidance-092025.pdf \"Potentiatl Government shutdown guidance\")\n**_Updated as of 7/01/2025_**\nOn July 01, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in the case  _Association of American Universities, et al. v.

HPC can offer users significant benefits in many applications. While not necessary for all projects, it is a very valuable tool for researchers who want to spend less time waiting on computations or simulations. \nImproved Speed and Efficiency\nHPC allows you to perform calculations and simulations much faster than you can on a regular desktop computer or laptop. This lets you complete tasks quickly, save time and money, and make more informed decisions.\nHandling for Large Datasets\nHPC can process and analyze large amounts of data more easily than conventional computers, which is vital in many fields, including data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nFlexibility and Scalability\nUsers can scale to much larger problem sizes and configurations when running on HPC.

        "url_238": "# Satisfactory Academic Progress \nInstitutions, like the University of Wyoming (UW), that participate in Title IV aid programs (federal financial aid) are responsible for ensuring that students receiving federal aid meet minimum standards. Our office must establish and enforce policies that monitor student progress towards completion of a degree or certificate. SAP is a federal mandate outlined in 34 CFR 668.34. \nTo continue receiving federal aid, as well as some other aid (institutional and state scholarships and grants), you must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). This is a series of standards centered on your grade point average, course completion rate, and the time frame in which you are completing your degree. SAP is monitored following each semester at the University of Wyoming (UW).\nStudents should read and understand the SAP Policy (see below).\nNavigation [ Main Page ](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa)\n* * *\n## SAP Policy Overview\nAs a financial aid recipient, you must maintain the following minimum standards to continue receiving financial aid:\n  * You must maintain a minimum cumulative UW grade point average (GPA). Only courses taken at UW will be included in that GPA calculation.\n  * You must complete and pass a minimum of 67% of all courses attempted. This is referred to as Pace. Passing a class requires a grade of A, B, C, D, or S.\n  * You must complete your degree within 150% of the minimum credit hours required to graduate. This is known as the Maximum Time Frame limit.\n\n\nYou will receive no federal financial aid, and possibly other types of aid like some scholarships and grants, until you make up your academic deficiencies or successfully appeal your status. Students who elect to appeal will need to complete the [appeal form AND Academic Plan](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/_files/docs/sap/satisfactory-academic-progress-2526.pdf).\nSee the expandable sections below for our full SAP Policy.\n* * *\n## SAP Notification Process\nStudents who are not meeting SAP standards are notified via email which will come from the Office of Scholarships & Financial (finaid@uwyo.edu) with the subject line, \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\". The email will note the reason you are not meeting SAP. Students who wish to appeal the SAP decision must complete and submit both the [appeal form and the Academic Plan](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/_files/docs/sap/satisfactory-academic-progress-2526.pdf) by the posted deadline contained in the email you received.\n* * *\nSAP POLICY\nSAP is reviewed at the end of each semester (fall, spring, and summer). The calculation includes both qualitative and quantitative measures to determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. Three areas are measured:\n  * Cumulative UW Grade Point Average (qualitative)\n  * Pace (quantitative)\n  * Maximum Timeframe (quantitative)\n\n\nCumulative UW Grade Point Average \n  * 2.0 GPA - Undergraduate and Professional programs\n  * 3.0 GPA - Graduate programs\n\n\nThe cumulative GPA includes all courses attempted at UW that are applicable to the student's program of study.\nTransfer credits are not included in the institutional (UW) GPA calculation, but they may affect the Pace of course completion.\nRepeated courses are included in the attempted hours, and the most recent grade is used in the GPA calculation per the [Office of the Registrar's policy](https://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/undergraduate-students/cumulative-gpa.html). See more details below in the \"Repeated Coursework\" section.\nPace \nA student's earned hours must be equal to, or exceed, 67% of all cumulative attempted hours since beginning classes. Pace is calculated by dividing the total number of overall earned credit hours by the total number of overall attempted credit hours. _Example: If a student has earned 45 credits and attempted 60 credits, their pace is 45 ÷ 60 = 0.75 (75%) which meets the 67% minimum requirement._\n  * Qualifying Grades: Courses that receive a grade of A, B, C, D, or S are considered both attempted and earned hours, including those taken through Study Abroad and/or a Consortium Agreement.\n  * Disqualifying Grades: Courses that are Failed, Withdrawn, Unsatisfactory, or Incomplete (F, W, U, or I) are considered attempted but not earned hours. Audit, correspondence, credit by exam, remedial, and enrichment courses also do not count as attempted or earned hours. \n    * For Incomplete grades, once a final grade is issued, the student's SAP standing will be re-evaluated at the next scheduled review after the then-current semester ends.\n  * Institutional Policy Status: Academic amnesty or \"fresh start\" provisions granted by the University of Wyoming do not apply to SAP calculations. All attempted credits, including those excluded from GPA under institutional policy, are included in the Pace calculation.\n  * Note: Credits earned while a student is not receiving federal aid, as well as experiential learning credits, are all counted as attempted and earned hours.\n\n\nMaximum Timeframe \nA student is eligible for financial aid until they have attempted 150% of the minimum credit hours required to earn a specific degree. UW sets the following maximum timeframe for student degrees:\n  * Undergraduate: 180 credit hours (150% of 120)\n  * Masters: 45 credit hours (150% of 30)\n  * Doctorate: 108 credit hours (150% of 72)\n  * Law: 135 credit hours (150% of 90)\n  * Pharmacy: 213 credit hours (150% of 142)\n  * Second Bachelors: 225 credit hours (150% of 125)\n\n\nUW Credits: All coursework attempted at UW is included in the Maximum Timeframe calculation, regardless of whether the student received Title IV aid during those terms.\nTransfer Credits: Accepted transfer credits count as attempted credits in the Maximum Timeframe calculation. Courses taken through a Consortium Agreement that are accepted towards the student's program are included in the calculation.\nInstitutional Policy Status: Academic amnesty or \"fresh start\" provisions granted by UW do not apply to any SAP calculations. All attempted credits, including those excluded from GPA under institutional policy, are included in the Maximum Timeframe calculation.\nFinancial Aid Eligibility Statuses \nFinancial Aid Warning\n  * Students who have not met the minimum standards for the previous semester will be placed on a 'Warning' status. Students on this status are eligible for financial aid for one (1) additional semester. Students who do not meet minimum standards at the end of their warning semester will be 'Not Eligible' for the next semester.\n\n\nNot Eligible\n  * Students will have a 'Not Eligible' status if they: \n    * do not meet SAP standards at the end of the warning semester,\n    * have a denied SAP appeal,\n    * did not fulfill the requirements of their approved Academic Plan, or\n    * have met their Maximum Timeframe.\n\n\nFinancial Aid Probation\n  * Students who have successfully appealed the status of 'Not Eligible' are placed on probation and are eligible to receive financial aid for at least one (1) more semester.\n  * Students on Probation status may continue receiving financial aid beyond that one semester if they are following an approved Academic Plan and are meeting the plan's terms. Academic Plans are reviewed at the end of each semester. Any deviations to the plan must be communicated to our office and approved before the end of the semester that was impacted. Otherwise, the Academic Plan will be failed and the student will not meet SAP standards again.\n\n\nReinstatement Options \nWhen not meeting SAP standards, or when their SAP appeal is denied, students can potentially reinstate their eligibility to receive federal aid by submitting a SAP appeal (see the next section) or by either of the following methods:\n  * They may enroll in coursework but will be responsible for payment of their university bill until they are once again meeting SAP standards, or\n  * They may take a minimum of 2 courses for a semester on their own that equal at least 6 credit hours and receive grades of \"C\" or better with no fails/withdrawals. If successful, they can appeal for the next semester.\n\n\nNote: [Payment plans](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/billing-and-payments.html) are available each semester. Students can potentially secure a [private loan](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/private-loans.html), but some lenders may require them to meet SAP standards to qualify for a loan.\nSAP Appeal Process \nA student who is \"Not Eligible\" for federal financial aid has the option to appeal if an extenuating circumstance* contributed to them not meeting SAP standards. The student must submit an appeal form, Academic Plan, and accompanying documentation** to the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid by the end of the add/drop period of the semester in which they are appealing. Appeals will not be heard in person.\nThe submitted forms and all supporting documentation will be presented to the SAP Appeal Committee for review. The review time for appeals may take 7-10 business days. Students will be notified of the results by UWYO email.\n  * Advisor signature and certification are required on any Academic Plan. Additionally, any SAP appeal form submitted without an Academic Plan will not be reviewed by the committee.\n  * If the appeal is granted, the notification will explain the terms of the approval. To continue with an approved Academic Plan, students must pass all their courses each semester with grades of \"C\" or better with no fails/withdrawals. Any necessary changes or deviations to an Academic Plan must be communicated to our office and approved before the end of the semester that was impacted.\n  * If the appeal is denied, students may request an additional review by the Director of Scholarships & Financial Aid if they have something to submit that was not included in the original appeal. The Director's decision will be final.\n\n\n*Examples of extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to, serious illness or injury, death of an immediate family member, mental health challenges diagnosed by a medical professional, or other significant personal hardship.\n**Documentation may include medical records, death certificates, court documents, or letters from licensed professionals.\nRepeated Coursework \nUnder federal financial aid regulations, a student may receive aid for one repeat of a previously passed course. On the third attempt, federal aid will not cover that course. All repeated courses are included in a student's attempted credit hours, which may negatively affect the Pace component of SAP.\nAdditional Considerations \nBeing declared \"Not Eligible\" for federal financial aid does not mean a student has been academically dismissed from UW.\nSome scholarships and grants require a student to meet SAP standards. Even if you do not accept federal aid, you may not be eligible to receive that aid without improving your SAP status or successfully appealing.\nMany scholarship recipients are required to maintain a higher credit hour level or grade point average than outlined in this policy. Guidelines on the minimum acceptable credits/GPA for scholarships are outlined on our [Renewing Your Financial Aid page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/index.html) and are contained within the Terms & Conditions each student is directed to through their offer letter they received initially.\n* * *\nSAP FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQS)\nMost questions about SAP can be answered by reviewing the SAP Policy, but we have captured those questions below that most students have about the SAP process!\nWhy am I not eligible for financial aid? \nIf you are not meeting SAP standards, you are ineligible to receive federal financial aid. Review the SAP Policy on this page for details. You can also view the reason you are not meeting SAP by logging into WyoRecords,\nCan I receive financial aid while I am not meeting SAP standards? \nNo. You cannot receive federal financial aid if your status is 'Not Eligible'. The SAP Policy explains how you can become eligible again.\nI never received federal aid before. Why must I submit an appeal? \nAll financial aid applicants are subject to the standards of the SAP Policy, regardless of whether or not aid was received in the past.\nWhat is considered a \"complete\" SAP appeal? \nA complete SAP appeal is one that:\n  * has no blanks (is fully filled out),\n  * explains clearly what happened and what you have done/are doing to resolve that in the future,\n  * includes the second page (Academic Plan) that is also fully filled out,\n  * has your advisor's signature on the Academic Plan\n  * includes any necessary documentation to substantiate the claim of your extenuating circumstance, and\n  * is submitted by the semester's deadline (noted in the email you received).\n\n\nI did not file a Fall SAP appeal; do I still need to file a Spring appeal? \nYes. You must file a spring appeal for consideration of spring aid, unless your fall semester puts you back in good SAP standing.\nHow long does it take for a SAP appeal to be reviewed? \nProcessing times can vary, depending upon the time of year, but we ask that you allow 7-10 business days for the committee to review and respond.\nHow do I submit a SAP appeal? \nYou may drop it off in person to our office in Knight Hall (Rm 174), email it to finaidappeal@uwyo.edu from your own UWYO email address, or mail it to us at Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid, University of Wyoming, 1000 E University Ave Dept 3335, Laramie WY 82071\nWhat can I do if my SAP appeal is denied? \nIf your SAP appeal is denied, you may:\n  * enroll in coursework but you will be responsible for payment of your university bill until you are once again meeting SAP standards, or\n  * take a minimum of 2 courses for a semester on their own that equal at least 6 credit hours and receive grades of \"C\" or better with no fails/withdrawals. If successful, then you can appeal for the next semester.\n\n\nNote: [Payment plans](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/billing-and-payments.html) are available each semester. Students can potentially secure a [private loan](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/private-loans.html), but some lenders may require you to be meeting SAP standards to qualify for a loan.\nI want to withdraw from a class. How will this affect my SAP status? \nIf you have an approved Academic Plan and are on SAP probation, withdrawing from a class will result in a \"W\" grade. When we review your SAP status at the end of that semester, you will no longer be meeting the requirements of your approved appeal or SAP standards, and you will not be eligible to receive financial aid again.\nI want to withdraw from the University. How will this affect my SAP status? \nThe hours you attempted during the term you withdraw will still be included in the calculation to determine your Pace (earned hours divided by attempted hours). Those hours will also be included in the calculation for Maximum Timeframe. Therefore, withdrawing from the University could negatively impact both and result in you not meeting SAP standards when you return to college.\nI haven't attended college for years, and I've changed my major several times. Does the SAP Policy apply to me? \nYes. Your academic record follows you through your lifetime, so any courses attempted and earned/not earned will be a part of your record at UW. Remember, students can appeal and provide information and documentation about their specific academic journey that has caused them to not meet SAP standards.\nCan my parents get a Parent PLUS Loan if I am not meeting SAP standards? \nNo. Since that is a type of federal loan, the student must be meeting SAP standards in order for their parents to possibly qualify for a PLUS Loan.\nAre there any tips for submitting a SAP Appeal? \nTake your time to compose your statement and complete your appeal form and Academic Plan as this is your opportunity to describe your situation for consideration!\nBe sure to include details on what steps you will take in the future to meet the SAP standards in the future.\nProvide documentation to substantiate your reason for the SAP appeal. Uploading your transcript is unnecessary as we have access to those records. \nIMPORTANT: If your appeal is approved, you must complete each semester as documented in your Academic Plan and receiving at least a \"C\" grade with no withdrawals/fails. Any changes to an Academic Plan must be submitted to, and approved by, our office before the end of that semester or you will again not be meeting SAP standards.\nHow will my SAP appeal be evaluated by the committee? \nSeveral factors are considered in the review of SAP appeals. Below are the most common and important questions the committee may consider in evaluating the merits of the appeal.\n  * Does the appeal thoroughly explain and detail the student's extenuating circumstances?\n  * Are the circumstances presented in the appeal beyond the student's control?\n  * Does the appeal explain the changes the student has made to address the circumstances and allow him/her to meet the SAP standards at the next evaluation or at a specific point in time? What resources has the student used or will the student use in the future?\n  * Is the student's explanation consistent with their transcript and other academic records?\n  * For students not meeting the GPA standard, what trend has their GPA followed?\n  * For students not meeting the Pace standard, does their transcript demonstrate consistency in credit hour completion?\n  * Is the academic plan realistic considering the student's circumstances and past academic performance?\n  * How many times has the student appealed for SAP? If the student's appeal was approved, why did they not meet the SAP standards or follow their Academic Plan? Are the circumstances of the current appeal similar to the circumstances of a prior appeal?\n  * If the student appealed in the past, did they implement the changes stated on the prior appeal? If not, why?\n\n\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

See important information below FAQ section._\n* * *\nSummer financial Aid FAQS\nWhen will summer financial aid be awarded? \nAwarding of summer financial aid will begin in April and continue up to the last week of summer semester. If you are eligible to receive federal aid, we need that last week to ensure your loans can pay out before the end of the semester and academic year.\nWhen will summer financial aid disburse (pay out) to my student account? \nBecause summer semester has a variety of session lengths and occurs at the end of the academic year, it disburses differently than fall or spring semesters:\n  * Federal aid (loans and grants) will disburse on the first day of your first scheduled course.\n  * Scholarship aid will disburse on the first day of summer semester.\n\n\nDisbursement of federal aid can only happen if you are meeting SAP requirements (see the next FAQ below). Additionally, there may be a delay if your first summer course starts during the first summer session, as we will be finalizing the eligibility review for aid.\nWill I receive summer financial aid if I am not making Satisfactory Academic Progress? \nYou cannot receive federal financial aid if you do not meet[Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/sap/index.html)\nThe deadline to have your summer SAP appeal and supporting documentation submitted to our office is July 15. You may reach out to finaidappeal@uwyo.edu with any questions.\nCan I receive a Pell Grant during summer semester? \nAll undergraduate, first-degree seeking students will be evaluated for Pell Grant eligibility after they register for summer courses. If you are a transfer student, make sure that UW has been listed as a school on your 2024-2025 FAFSA.\n*Full-time status for undergraduate students is enrollment in 12 credit hours per semester. Part-time status for undergraduate students is enrollment in anything less than 12 credit hours per semester.\nCan I apply for a private student loan to cover my summer expenses? \nYes, some private student loans are available for summer semester, even if you are enrolled part-time*. You may review[a list of private lenders](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/private-loans.html)\n*See definition of part-time status in this page’s introduction section above.\nCan I qualify for a Work-Study award during summer semester? \nCurrently summer Work-Study awards at UW have been reserved for College of Law students who are involved in summer law clinics. We can determine, on a case-by-case basis, if you may be eligible for summer Work-Study dependent on your summer enrollment after July 1. Please contact our office for more information.\nIf all my summer courses are online, can I still apply for summer financial aid? \nYes, you may apply for summer financial aid if you are taking any type of course, whether online, in-person, or a combination of both.\nWill I receive summer financial aid to pay for living expenses? \nYour summer financial aid will first be applied to your summer tuition and fee charges, even though summer Cost of Attendance (COA) may include a living expenses component. If you are awarded more financial aid than you have tuition/fee charges, you will have a credit balance and will qualify to receive a refund. Your refund could be used to help pay for living expenses.\nIf you feel that your actual expenses exceed the standard summer COA, you can complete a[COA Appeal](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals.html).\nCan I receive summer financial aid if I am also taking courses at another institution? \nYou can combine your hours between two or more institutions to qualify for summer financial aid by using a[consortium agreement](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/consortium-agreement.html)\nConsortium agreements require enrollment in at least 6 credit hours* at UW during fall or spring semesters, but the enrollment requirement for summer semester is only one (1) course at UW.\n*Exceptions are the ReNew and Med Tech programs\nWhat happens to my summer financial aid if I decide to drop or withdraw, or if I fail a summer course? \nDropping a course, withdrawing from a course, or withdrawing from all courses may cause an adjustment to your summer financial aid package since there is not a date where enrollment locks as with other semesters. This could result in our office returning all, or a portion, of your federal aid which might result in you owing a balance to the University of Wyoming. This includes any necessary adjustments to the Pell Grant.\nIf you fail a summer course, it could adversely impact your meeting[Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) requirements](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/sap/index.html)\nI will be participating in the Summer Bridge program. How do I apply for summer financial aid? \nIf you are a newly admitted Summer Bridge Scholar, your financial aid application process is identical to that of a newly admitted student. Simply follow the steps above under the Federal Aid section on this page.\nIn addition, be sure to follow all instructions provided by the Summer Bridge staff. Check with them for summer program related questions. More information about the[Summer Bridge program](https://www.uwyo.edu/summerbridge/)\nWhen will I see my summer billing statement, and when is payment due? \n[Important dates](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/important-dates.html) for billing and payments are maintained by the Student Financial Services' office for each semester.\nWhere can I find more information regarding the summer refund schedule? \nPlease review the Student Financial Services’ website about[withdrawals and refunds](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/withdrawals.html). The refund schedule is also accessible in WyoRecords under the Student Account tab.\nWe encourage you to sign up for electronic refunds ([WyoRefunds](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/refunds.html)) to expedite the refund process.\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

For more information please refer to our [Contact Us](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/contact-us.html) page.\nDo I have to schedule an appointment with the financial aid office? \nWe accept drop-ins during normal business hours, but students and families are always welcome to [book](https://outlook.office.com/book/UWScholarshipsFinancialAid@uwy.onmicrosoft.com/?ismsaljsauthenabled) a virtual or in-person meeting at a time that works best for you!\nHow can I determine how much it will cost to attend UW? \n[Cost of Attendance](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/index.html) (COA) is not a bill but is an _estimate_ of school-related expenses a full-time student can expect to have for an academic year. COA includes direct expenses (those billed by UW), as well as indirect expenses, and it considers a student’s residency status, living arrangements and, in some cases, the student’s major. Be sure to consider COA, as well as any financial aid you have been offered, to determine what your out-of-pocket expenses might be.\nCan I concurrently attend UW and another institution? \nYes. Students can attend two or more institutions and combine credit hours by completing a consortium agreement. Using a consortium agreement can help you maintain full-time enrollment status for financial aid purposes. Some rules apply, so be sure to review the [consortium agreement process](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/a-z-index-of-topics/consortium.html). Please note that you can only receive federal aid or the Hathaway Scholarship (if eligible) from only one institution.\nWhy wouldn’t you tell my family about my financial aid when they called? \nOnce your first semester starts, or you turn 18 years of age, the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) prohibits us from discussing any of your specific financial matters with anyone but you _without your written permission_. Please visit our office to obtain the FERPA release form and complete it, or you may [download](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/_files/docs/ferpa_release_form.docx) it. Completed forms can be turned into our office with proof of ID. You may fax the form to us (307-766-3800) but must still provide proof of ID.\nAnother option would be to create an [authorized user](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/authorized-user-setup.html) account for family members, or others within your support network, to give them access to your billing information. This also allows us to discuss your financial aid with them if they call, email, or stop by our office. If you have Authorized Users, you won’t also have to complete a separate FERPA release form!\nWhy isn’t my financial aid showing as authorized aid against my charges in WyoRecords? \nThere could be a variety of reasons, depending upon what type of financial aid it is. The best thing is to call our office so we can help troubleshoot the problem and see if you still have some outstanding documents or requirements holding up your aid.\nWhen will my financial aid disburse (pay out) each semester to my UW student account? \nAuthorized financial aid will be disbursed towards your university-billed charges.\n  * Fall and Spring semesters disbursement occurs the evening following the end of the Drop Period. For example, if Drop Period ends at midnight on Wednesday, financial aid will disburse Thursday evening. Please see the [semester schedule](https://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/calendar.html)as maintained by the Registrar's office.\n  * Summer semester disbursement occurs based upon the type of aid: Federal aid will disburse on the first day of your first class. All other aid will disburse on the first day of the summer semester.\n\n\n**Hint** : You can always access this information in WyoRecords. On your Offer tab, select the aid year in question, and then click the “Payment Schedule” button in the upper right corner. That will provide a specific disbursement date for each semester!\nCan the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid answer questions about my student account? \nActually [Student Financial Services](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/index.html) handles questions regarding the following: Account balances, Payment dates and payment plans, status of refunds, tax form 1098-T, etc. They may be contacted via phone at (307) 766-6233, email at sfs@uwyo.edu, or they are located next door to our office in Knight Hall Room 172.\nI need to provide verification of my enrollment. How do I request that? \nThat is handled by UW’s Office of the Registrar, and they have [detailed instructions](https://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/transcripts-enrollment-verification/enrollment-verification.html) on the process.\nAre there any financial aid restrictions for Study Abroad? \nFederal aid, including grants and loans, can be applied towards the educational costs associated with any type of study abroad program.\nStudents who are receiving renewing institutional scholarships, including Commitments, must be enrolled in a UW 4001 level study abroad course (an exchange program), with tuition billed by UW, for your scholarship to disburse. If you enroll in a non-exchange study abroad program, your scholarship will not disburse but will count towards your maximum number of semesters of use.\nHow do I provide feedback to the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid? \nOur office welcomes feedback from the UW Community (students, families, faculty, and staff). Please direct all concerns to our office for prompt resolution. If your need is not satisfied at this level, please complete this [survey](https://uwyo.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ac3ou5S1Hgu0pjE).\nYou may also schedule an appointment with our Director for final resolution.\n## Things that Impact Financial Aid\nHow do I petition for in-state Wyoming residency for tuition purposes? \nThat process is handled by UW’s Office of the Registrar, and you can learn more about the [process and requirements](https://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/residency.html). We urge you to [meet with a financial aid advisor](https://uwyo.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9kDceMGcALTiVD) about potential impacts to your financial aid if you are successful at petitioning.\nIf you have been awarded a renewing non-resident Commitment or Award, and your residency status changes within your first year, students will be switched to a renewing  _resident_ Commitment at the appropriate level. If your residency status changes beyond your first year, your non-resident Commitment or Award will not be replaced.\nI want to go from full-time to part-time enrollment. How will that affect my financial aid? \nSome financial aid requires certain enrollment levels to remain eligible to receive funds. We always urge students to contact our office before making any decisions about withdrawing from courses or changing your enrollment status in any way so you understand the potential impact to your current and future financial aid before making the decision.\nWhat happens to my financial aid if I need to withdraw from school? \nWe understand sometimes there may be a need to withdraw from either one class or from all of them. Withdrawing may impact your financial aid and some funds may need to be returned. We strongly encourage you to read our [Federal Return of Funds Policy](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/course-schedule-changes.html) before you withdraw and [meet with a financial aid advisor](https://uwyo.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_b9kDceMGcALTiVD) to make sure you are informed before you make any decisions that could impact your financial aid.\nWe also suggest you review [renewing eligibility requirements](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/) for your financial aid, including Satisfactory Academic Progress for federal aid and requirements for renewing scholarships.\nHow do mixed enrollment levels affect my financial aid? \nIf you enroll in courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in any semester, that may affect your eligibility to receive some types of financial aid, including scholarships. You should contact our office immediately to determine any impact.\n## Applying for Financial Aid\nHow do I apply for financial aid? \nThe first step is to apply for admission to UW and submit your transcript and test scores (if applicable). Students are then reviewed for renewing scholarship eligibility and awarded, if you qualify.\nTo apply for federal or need-based aid at UW you need to complete the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/). Certain types of aid, including loans, do require additional paperwork AFTER you have been awarded that aid. More information can be found on our [Applying for Financial Aid](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/index.html) page.\nWhat is the deadline to apply for financial aid? \nThe most important thing to know is the earlier the better! February 1st our priority date for the upcoming academic year aid, so this is the date that we recommend you complete the FAFSA by so you have the best chance for some funding that is limited each year. But if that timeline doesn’t work for you, it’s okay! Each FAFSA is open for a 21-month cycle, so you can apply up through June 30th of an aid year. Example: for the 2025-2026 FAFSA, it will be opened through June 30, 2026.\nI don’t think I will qualify for aid based on finances. Should I apply anyway? \nYes! The FAFSA is free to complete each year, but many families mistakenly think they don’t qualify for aid. In the end, they might prevent themselves from receiving financial aid because they fail to apply for it. In addition, there are a few sources of aid, such as unsubsidized and PLUS loans, that are available to students _regardless_ of financial need.\nDo I have to apply for financial aid every year? \nYes! You must complete and submit a FAFSA at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) every year because each form uses a different tax year.\nWhy is my Federal Direct Loan not accepted on WyoWeb? \nStudents are required to accept or decline the Federal Direct Loans that we offer based upon your FAFSA results. Once accepted, the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid must process the loan with the U.S. Department of Education which normally takes 2-3 business days but can take longer. If you have accepted a loan and it has still not paid within that time period, you may be missing information. Please contact our office for assistance.\nHow will I know if I have completed everything for financial aid? \nCheck your financial aid status often by logging into your student account in WyoRecords: Navigate to WyoWeb > WyoRecords > Students and log in. From your Checklist, select the appropriate Financial Aid Year Requirements (example: Financial Aid Year 2025-2026 Requirements) and look for anything in the Outstanding Requirements section.\nYou should also check your campus email frequently throughout the year for correspondence from our office.\nHow long does it take to be awarded financial aid? \nInitial eligibility for renewing scholarships will be determined at the time of your admission to UW. Each year we roll those scholarships to the next academic year in early December, and then determine after spring grades are posted if you have maintained ongoing eligibility for them.\nFor federal aid, we won’t start packaging for the next academic year until early February. If you are admitted to UW beginning in spring semester, we normally package in early January, but you can always check with us before to see if your requirements are met, and we can package earlier for you.\nFor any FAFSA received after the initial packaging begins in February, the packaging process will occur daily during the week, as long as there are no outstanding requirements.\nShould I send in my tax forms and other paperwork even if they haven’t been requested? \nNo, please do not submit income tax forms unless we specifically ask for them on WyoWeb.\nWhy do my parents have to turn in tax documents? \nOccasionally our office is required to check the accuracy of income reported on the FAFSA. Our [Verification page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html) provides more details about this.\nHow can I apply for summer financial aid? \nOnce you have enrolled in a summer course in WyoRecords, you will see a pop-up message reminding you to complete the FAFSA, complete the Summer Financial Aid Application (the link is provided), and to enroll in at least 6 credit hours for summer semester in order to qualify for federal aid. Once you have completed those three requirements, you will be packaged for federal aid in April if you are eligible.\nThere are some [scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/summer-awards.html) available for summer semester that will require an application in WyoScholarships.\nHow do I accept or decline my financial aid or check on outstanding requirements? \nLog into WyoRecords > Students at [wyoweb.uwyo.edu](https://wyoweb.uwyo.edu/).\n  * On the left side of the screen, select the applicable aid year link (Financial Aid Year 20xx-20xx Awards) link under the Checklist to accept or decline aid. Access the corresponding Requirements link for outstanding financial aid requirements.\n  * On the Offer tab, scroll past the Cost of Attendance section (but we urge you to review it!) to review what aid has been offered to you. Some types will have been accepted on your behalf to save you a step (e.g., a Pell Grant).\n  * When we open the aid acceptance functionality (usually in March), you will be able follow the Offered link under the Take Action column and follow the prompts to accept or decline.\n\n\nRemember that when you accept aid, it will disburse (pay out) split equally between fall and spring semesters. The amount will also be slightly reduced by the Department of Education’s nominal origination fee.\n## Things Specific to FAFSA\nWhat is the FAFSA? \nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the application for all federal aid programs, and it also determines if you qualify for any institutional or state need-based aid. Be sure to indicate the University of Wyoming’s school code (003932) on the application so we receive your information from the U.S. Department of Education.\nIs FAFSA completion required at UW? \nNo, we do not require students to complete the FAFSA, but keep in mind that FAFSA results are the only way we can determine a student’s eligibility for some financial aid, including grants and some scholarships.\nFAFSA also needs to be completed every year since it uses a new tax year each time. The form opens on October 1 each year and uses the prior-prior tax year. For example: The 2025-2026 FAFSA uses the 2023 tax year. If this does not reflect your current situation, you can submit an appeal: See the “What if the FAFSA does not reflect my present situation?” question below.\nWhere do I access the FAFSA? \nYou can create your FSA ID and complete the FAFSA form on [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/).\nMy parents did not claim me on their tax return this year. Can I file my FAFSA as an Independent student? \nThe U.S. Department of Education have [specific questions](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency) that determine your dependency status for the FAFSA. They include questions about age, marital status, level in school, veteran status, dependent children, and special circumstances. If you feel that you should be considered an independent student, you may obtain the dependency appeal guidelines from our office. For more information see the [Unusual Circumstances appeal forms](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/unusual-circumstances-appeals.html).\nWho will be a contributor on my FAFSA? \nThe Department of Education has provided a [flowchart](https://studentaid.gov/help/who-is-parent) to help you determine who your FAFSA contributor(s) will be.\n_Dependent students_ :\n  * In general, all dependent students, even those who do not live with their parents, must provide their parent’s information on the FAFSA.\n  * If your legal parents (biological or adoptive) are married to each other, or are not married to each other and live together, you should report information about both of them on your FAFSA.\n  * If you have no contact with your parents and don’t know where they live, or you’ve left home due to an abusive situation, select “Yes” to the “Do unusual circumstances prevent the student from contacting their parents or would contacting their parents pose a risk to the student?” question on the FAFSA. You will be considered provisionally independent. You should contact our office to find out what supporting documentation you will need to submit.\n\n\n_Independent students_ :\n  * The spouse of an Independent student who is married may need to be a contributor on the FAFSA, depending upon how taxes were filed. If taxes were submitted as Married/Filing Jointly, the spouse does not need to be a contributor. If the tax filing status was Married/Filing Separately, the spouse will be a required contributor who must provide consent.\n\n\nWhat are the reasons a contributor might be asked to manually enter financial information on the FAFSA? \nSome of the most common reasons a contributor may be asked to manually enter their financial information on the FAFSA include:\n  * The contributor’s marital status has changed since filing their Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return for the applicable tax year (e.g., parents filed a joint tax return but are separated, divorced, or remarried when filing the FAFSA).\n  * The contributor filed taxes in a U.S. territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands), commonwealth, or foreign country.\n  * The contributor indicates on the online FAFSA that they have not filed a tax return but plan to.\n  * The contributor is a victim of IRS tax-related identity theft.\n  * The contributor's identifiers do not match IRS records.\n  * The transfer of FTI was incomplete.\n  * The IRS was unable to confirm tax return data.\n  * IRS data is unavailable for an IRS system-related outage at the time the FAFSA is being completed.\n\n\nCan FAFSA corrections be made electronically? \nYes. You can make allowable corrections to the FAFSA by returning to [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) and submitting your corrections electronically. Before doing so, we urge you to check with our office to determine if those changes are allowable or if they would revise the aid you originally qualified for.\nHow do I determine what my family size is for the FAFSA? \nThe number of people in your household (or your parent’s household) will align with the number of dependents on your U.S. tax return (or your parent’s tax return), and that information will transfer directly from the IRS. If this number changes after filing the tax return, you can indicate this update directly on your FAFSA.\nWhat if the FAFSA does not reflect my present situation? \nThere is an appeal form that can be completed to request a review of the amount of aid awarded or to update us with your current situation. For more information see the [Change of Circumstance appeal form](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/special-circumstance-appeals.html).\n## Federal Aid\nHow do I accept my federal student loans? \nAs a student, you will accept your Federal Direct Loans on your student account in WyoRecords. Navigate to WyoWeb > WyoRecords > Students and log in. From your Checklist, select the appropriate Financial Aid Year Awards (example: Financial Aid Year 20xx-20xx Awards). In the Loans section of the Offer tab, you can accept, reduce, or decline any loan that have been offered. Students who are first-time borrowers will need to complete [Loan Entrance Counseling](https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/) and a [Master Promissory Note](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/) on [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) before their loans can be disbursed by our office.\nParent PLUS loans cannot be accepted in WyoRecords. To apply for, and accept, a Parent PLUS loan, a parent must complete a [loan application](https://studentaid.gov/plus-app/) and a [Master Promissory Note](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/) on [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/).\nI’ve completed my loan requirements on studentaid.gov. Why is it still showing as a requirement on my student account? \nIt takes about 3 to 5 business days once you’ve submitted loan requirements for us to receive confirmation from the Department of Education of their completed status.\nI declined my student loan but have changed my mind. How do I get it back? \nIf the academic year hasn’t expired following summer semester, we can re-offer the loan. You need to request this in writing by emailing finaid@uwyo.edu and be sure to include your W-number.\nHow do I repay my student loans? \nRepayment on most Federal Direct Loans begins when you graduate, leave college, or drop below half-time enrollment. Repayment on PLUS loans, however, begins when the loan is fully disbursed.\nAll Federal Direct Loans have a loan servicer that handles billing and other services. You can find your loan servicer by visiting [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/plus-app/). Once you have identified your servicer, visit their website to research payment options or to make a loan payment. For private loans, contact your lender about repayment details.\nWhat is required to be eligible for a Work-Study position? \nTo be eligible for Work-Study, you must:\n  * Be an undergraduate or graduate student.\n  * Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and have financial need as determined by the FAFSA.\n  * Be enrolled in at least half-time status (6 credit hours for undergraduate students or 4.5 credit hours for graduate students).\n  * Due to limited funding, not all students who are eligible will receive a Work-Study offer. Awards are generally restricted to applicants who complete the FAFSA by February 1 of any given year.\n  * Finally, it is the student’s responsibility, if initially awarded a Work-Study offer, to apply for and start working in a Work-Study position before funds will pay out.\n\n\nHow do I find a Work-Study position? \nIf you have been awarded a Work-Study offer, you can review and apply for positions through the [Human Resources website](https://eeik.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions?lastSelectedFacet=TITLES&selectedTitlesFacet=Work%20Study). Work-Study positions will start posting on July 1 each year.\nI wasn’t offered Work-Study in my financial aid package? What can I do? \nStudents can be considered for a Work-Study award by completing our [waitlist survey form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=rdfN-V2CAUaOnKMl4C1S2nUOSL91A3tNvil4tQBOAIpUQUhESURBRDhSSDFVTksyWTNRWkxZQ085Ni4u). If you completed the FAFSA and demonstrate financial need, _and if funding is available_ , we will begin awarding students from the waitlist no sooner than the 4th week of the semester (fall/spring). You will be contacted through your campus email if you qualify and if funding is available for a late Work-Study offer.\nIf you are not awarded Work-Study, but still want to work part-time on campus, you can apply for [non Work-Study job opportunities](https://eeik.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions?lastSelectedFacet=TITLES&selectedFlexFieldsFacets=%22AttributeChar11%7CYes%22&selectedTitlesFacet=Part-Time+Worker).\nWhat is required to be eligible for a Pell Grant? \nTo be eligible for a Pell Grant, you must:\n  * Be an undergraduate student.\n  * Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and have financial need as determined by the FAFSA.\n  * Be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours (part-time enrollment). In the summer, you can receive a Pell Grant if you are enrolled in less than 6 credit hours.\n  * Still have remaining Pell Grant edibility (Lifetime Eligibility Used, or LEU).\n\n\nWhat are the Title IV Authorizations on my checklist? \nThere are three Title IV Authorizations that students should complete. These can be revised at any time, if you choose to.\n  * **Title IV Charges Authorization** – Federal financial aid will always be paid against standard charges that are tuition, fees, housing, and dining charges. But, should you have any excess federal financial aid remaining after your standard charges are paid, authorizing this requirement would let some of that extra aid go to pay non-standard charges, which could be student health charges, bookstore charges, parking fees, etc. _We usually suggest that students authorize this requirement._\n  * **Prior Year Authorization** – Should you ever have prior year non-standard charges, authorizing this requirement would allow UW to use federal financial aid for the current year to pay those charges off, as long as they total less than $200. _We usually suggest that students authorize this requirement._\n  * **Hold Title IV Credit Balances Authorization** – This requirement basically is a choice between who holds and controls any excess federal financial aid you may have in any semester. If you authorize it, UW would hold those excess funds and apply them to your account in a future semester. Keep in mind, however, that UW can only hold those through the current financial aid year, so they won’t continue to roll forward from year-to-year. Declining this requirement will result in any excess federal financial aid being processed as a refund and provided to you the student to hold and manage. _We usually suggest that students decline this requirement._\n\n\n## Scholarships\nHow can I qualify for a scholarship at UW? \nThe University of Wyoming is proud to offer a variety of renewing scholarship opportunities for new first-time and transfer students. These opportunities are based on your academic achievements at the time of admission to UW. See our [Scholarship](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/index.html) page for more information.\nContinuing students who do not qualify for a renewing scholarship are strongly encouraged to complete the General Application in the [WyoScholarships](https://uwyo.academicworks.com/) system each year, and then your student data will help determine if there are any scholarships you can receive.\nAre there any important deadlines for scholarships at UW? \nYes. All incoming students need to [confirm their enrollment](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/nextsteps.html) by certain dates to retain any renewing Commitment or scholarship that has been awarded:\n  * Fall Semester: confirm by May 1, at 11:59 pm MT (new first-time students) or by August 1, at 11:59 pm MT (new transfer students)\n  * Spring Semester: confirm by January 5, at 11:59 pm MT (both new first-time students and transfer students)\n  * Commitments will not be awarded after these dates without a successful [appeal](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/scholarship-appeals.html).\n\n\nScholarships that require an application within the WyoScholarships system normally open November 15 and close on March 15. Those scholarships won't be awarded until the next academic year. Example: Those that closed on March 15, 2025 were for academic year 2026-2027.\nIf I enroll in summer semester at UW before officially starting in the fall will I still be eligible for my merit Commitment or scholarship in the fall? \nSummer enrollment prior to attending the fall semester at UW does not impact eligibility  _as long as_ your official admission record is documented with fall semester as your admittance term.\nAfter being accepted at UW, I attended a different school. If I decide to attend UW later, can I still receive the renewing Commitment or scholarship that I was originally awarded? \nNew First-Time Students: When you reapply to UW after attending another school, you will be considered a _transfer student_. That will make you ineligible for the original renewing Commitment or scholarship, but we will consider you for a [Transfer Commitment](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/transfers/) using your post high school transfer credit hours and GPA.\nTransfer Students: If you choose to reapply and attend UW in the future, we will review your updated transfer GPA to reevaluate if you are still eligible for any renewing Commitment or scholarship.\nI was offered a renewing Commitment. How can I be reevaluated for a higher level? \nUW merit Commitments and scholarships for new first-time and transfer students are determined as part of the admission application process. If you submit a final transcript (high school or transfer) and/or new test scores (ACT or SAT, for new first-time only) by the _first day of class of your first semester_ , we will review to determine if you qualify for a higher level.\nIf you want us to consider your high school weighted GPA, you will need to request that by completing an [Initial Eligibility Scholarship Appeal form](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/scholarship-appeals.html). Be sure to submit before the deadline noted on that form.\nRenewing Commitment and scholarship levels will not be increased for students after they start receiving the scholarship.\nWhy is my Commitment showing in WyoRecords as $0.00 and marked as \"fulfilled\"? \nBecause the Commitment is just a pledge of scholarship support, there is no actual money attached to it. So, each year we will  _fulfill_ it with actual scholarships for at least the amount of the Commitment. Don't be alarmed if you receive completed different fulfilling scholarships each year!\nMy department or college told me they awarded me a scholarship, but I don't see it in WyoRecords. Where is it? \nIf you are eligible to receive a renewing Commitment, more than likely that scholarship will be used to  _fulfill_ your Commitment. You may not be seeing it yet because our office controls when those scholarships are released each year, usually during the month of July.\nHow do I send an external scholarship to the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid? \nSee our [External Scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/external-scholarships.html) page for instructions. There is also a form on that page that we strongly encourage external donors to use when submitting payments.\nCan I take one or more semesters off and keep my renewing scholarship? \nAll renewing Commitments and scholarships, including the Hathaway scholarship for eligible resident students, require continuous full-time enrollment in both fall and spring semesters at UW.\nStudents can request to defer their Commitment of scholarship for religious service or military service only, after providing appropriate documentation to our office.\nWhat if I have questions on the Hathaway Scholarship? \nThere is a separate [FAQ page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/faqs.html) specific to the Hathaway Scholarship.\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

The standards are determined by which level of scholarship you qualify for and your enrollment level when the scholarship pays each semester. Expand the sections below to learn more.\nIf you do not meet the eligibility standards, you will lose your Hathaway scholarship. However, you can regain it by meeting the requirements again, as outlined below. If you have extenuating circumstances, you may also submit an [appeal](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/scholarship-appeals.html) to potentially have your scholarship reinstated.\n[INFO ON HATHAWAY](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/index.html)\nHathaway Scholarship Renewing Standards\nMinimum GPA Standard \nAfter initiating the scholarship, you must maintain a minimum Hathaway GPA as follows:\n  * Honors and Performance Levels = 2.5*\n  * Opportunity and Provisional Levels = 2.25\n\n\nThe Hathaway GPA is calculated beginning with the initiation semester and will include any coursework taken at UW or a Wyoming community college thereafter, even if Hathaway Scholarship funds are not received in any given semester.\n*Students who drop below a 2.5 Hathaway GPA but maintain a 2.25 or better may receive the Opportunity Level until the Hathaway GPA reaches the minimum level again. At that time, you must self-identify by contacting our office.\n_Note: The two other standards must also be met to receive this lower level award._\nMinimum Credit Hour Standard \nWhen receiving Hathaway Scholarship funds, you must successfully complete* a minimum number of credit hours each semester or academic year based upon your level of enrollment as follows:\n  * Part-time Enrollment: Required to successfully complete 6 credit hours per semester (if enrolled in a single semester) or a total of 12 credit hours each academic year (fall and spring semesters).\n  * Blended Enrollment (part-time/full-time or full-time/part-time): Required to successfully complete a total of 18 credit hours each academic year (fall and spring semesters).\n  * Full-time Enrollment: Required to successfully complete 12 hours per semester (if enrolled in a single semester) or a total of 24 credit hours each academic year (fall and spring semesters).\n\n\n*Successfully completing a course means you receive a grade of A, B, C, D, and S.\nFor students using a consortium agreement to combine hours between institutions, all courses taken and completed at each Wyoming institution will be included in the calculation for your Minimum Credit Hour Standard.\nContinuous Enrollment Standard \nStudents must enroll at an eligible institution every fall and spring semester after initiating the scholarship. Failing to enroll in this manner will result in loss of eligibility. Exceptions can be made for students who defer the scholarship for full-time religious service or to serve in the military when documentation has been provided.\nRegaining Hathaway Scholarship \nStudents who do not maintain eligibility standards, as documented above, will lose your Hathaway Scholarship. You may be able to regain the scholarship if your sixth year of eligibility has not expired (see more details on our [Hathaway page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/index.html)) AND if you meet the necessary requirements below. Please note that a student can lose Hathaway for not maintaining one, or all, of the three standards.\nMinimum GPA Standard: You can regain Hathaway in a future semester once your Hathaway GPA has improved to the minimum level. You  _can_ use summer coursework to improve your Hathaway GPA if your enroll in, and successfully complete, at least 6 credit hours during the semester. You will need to self-identify to our office that you completed summer coursework and are meeting this standard.\nMinimum Credit Hour Standard: You can regain Hathaway by attending one semester and successfully completing at least 6 credit hours, while also meeting the Minimum GPA Standard. You  _can_ use summer coursework to regain eligibility for this standard, and you must self-identify to our office when you are meeting this standard.\nContinuous Enrollment Standard: You can regain Hathaway by completing one semester based upon the enrollment status when you last received Hathaway funds, while also maintaining the Minimum GPA Standard. You  _are not_ able to use summer coursework to reestablish your Continuous Enrollment status, and you must self-identify to our office when you are meeting this standard.\nWyoming's Tomorrow Scholarship\nEligibility for this scholarship requires students to meet certain standards at the end of each semester, including summer (if enrolled).

        "url_244": "# Types of Financial Aid\nThere are several types of financial aid available at the University of Wyoming. Students may qualify for scholarships or grants - those are considered 'free money' as they don't typically need to be repaid. Eligible students can participate in Work-Study programs that allow them to earn money through part-time jobs to help pay for college expenses. There are also different loans available that must be repaid with interest.\nIf you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you may qualify for different federal aid options to help you pay for college. The federal government is the largest source of financial aid. Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office within the U.S. Department of Education, administers the programs.

These grants are awarded only to students who demonstrate financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Grants generally do not need to be paid back except under certain circumstances when withdrawing from one or more courses after funds have been disbursed.\nPell Grant - Undergraduate only \nThese are [federal grants](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell) made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need on the FAFSA and have not earned a bachelor’s degree yet. You may not receive Pell Grant funds from more than one school at a time.\nStudents can receive a pro-rated amount of Pell Grant if they are enrolled in less than full-time hours. Pell Grants are not affected by other aid and may be available to you for enrollment in summer semester; however, there is a [Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU)](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell/calculate-eligibility) limit on the amount of Pell Grant funds you can receive in total that may impact that.\nEffective July 1, 2023, Pell Grant eligibility was restored for confined or incarcerated students enrolled in an eligible Prison Education Program.\nStarting in the 2024-2025 aid year, the FAFSA Simplification Act replaced the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant (IASG) and Children of Fallen Heroes (CFH) with the Special Rule for Pell Grants. This allows students under 33 years of age, whose parent or guardian died in the line of duty, to receive a maximum Pall Grant, regardless of FAFSA SAI (Student Aid Index). Financial Aid Administrators must certify eligibility for this grant.\nSupplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) - Undergraduate only \nThese are [federal grants](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/fseog) made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need on the FAFSA and have not earned a bachelor's degree yet. Limited funds exist each year, so awards are generally restricted to qualifying applicants who complete the FAFSA by priority deadlines and are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Priority is given to students who also receive a Pell Grant; however, students who do not receive a Pell Grant may still be eligible for a FSEOG if funds remain after Pell Grant recipients have been awarded.\nTeacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant (TEACH) - Education majors only \nThese are [federal grants](https://studentaid.gov/teach-grant-program) made to eligible undergraduate students who are completing, or plan to complete, coursework that is required to begin a career in teaching that is a TEACH Grant eligible program, and who agree to:\n  * teach full-time for at least four (4) years at either an elementary or secondary school;\n  * teach at a school or educational service agency that services low-income students;\n  * teach in a high-need field as defined by the Department of Education; and\n  * complete the four years of teaching within eight years after you graduate from the institution where you received TEACH Grants.\n\n\nIf a recipient of this grant does not complete the teaching service obligation, all amounts of TEACH Grant you received will be converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan that the student must repay, with interest, to the Department of Education. You will be charged interest from the date the grant(s) was disbursed.\nStudents interested in this type of grant should review all the details and requirements of the program using the link provided above.\n## Federal Work-Study Program\nThe U.S. Department of Education offers the [Federal Work-Study Program](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study) (Work-Study) to undergraduate and graduate students who demonstrate financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Work-Study allows students part-time employment opportunities while they are enrolled in school to earn money to help pay educational expenses. The program is available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students who are enrolled at UW either part– or full-time. Limited funds exist each year, so awards are generally restricted to qualifying applicants who complete the FAFSA by priority deadlines (February 1st) and are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.\nThe award will be a part of a student’s financial aid package. If you decline to accept your Work-Study award, you may have the option of converting your Work-Study to a loan if you have remaining loan eligibility.\nSecuring a Work-Study Position \nOnce you have accepted the award, you will need to review and apply for [Work-Study positions](https://eeik.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions?lastSelectedFacet=TITLES&selectedTitlesFacet=Work%20Study) through the UW Human Resources website. Students who secure a Work-Study position will receive an hourly wage determined by the department you are working for and the skills required, but it will not be less than the federal minimum wage. Part-time employees are paid every two weeks, and a schedule of these pay periods can be found on the [UW Payroll website](https://www.uwyo.edu/hr/payroll/index.html).\nPayroll Process for Work-Study \nStudents will be required to keep track of their time and enter it into the WyoCloud/HCM System, and supervisors will be required to approve all entered time before your paycheck will be processed. Paychecks are either directly deposited into your bank account or mailed to the address you have on file. Direct Deposit is the preferred method, and you can complete/submit a [Direct Deposit Form](https://www.uwyo.edu/hr/payroll/index.html) to Payroll.\nWork-Study Waitlist \nIf you were not offered a Work-Study award, and you would like to be considered for the program, please add your name to the [Work-Study Waitlist](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=rdfN-V2CAUaOnKMl4C1S2nUOSL91A3tNvil4tQBOAIpUQUhESURBRDhSSDFVTksyWTNRWkxZQ085Ni4u) by completing the survey. _If funding is available_ , we will begin awarding students from the waitlist no sooner than the 4th week of the semester (fall and spring). You will be contacted through your UWYO email if you qualify and receive a late Work-Study offer, and you will still be required to secure a Work-Study position.\nEmployment Options Other Than Work-Study \nIf you are not eligible to receive Work-Study, but still wish to be employed part-time on campus, you can apply for those [non Work-Study positions](https://eeik.fa.us2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/requisitions?lastSelectedFacet=TITLES&selectedFlexFieldsFacets=%22AttributeChar11%7CYes%22&selectedTitlesFacet=Part-Time+Worker) through the UW Human Resources website. The payroll process will be identical to that listed in the section above for Work-Study positions.\n## Federal Direct Loans\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s federal student loan program is the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (Direct Loan) Program. Under this program, the Department of Education is your lender for the different types of loans below. Students or parents will apply for these loans at [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) after the FAFSA is completed. All Direct Loans must be paid back with interest and all have a [fixed interest rate](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates) determined by the Department of Education annually on July 1st. Additionally, a small [loan fee](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/interest-rates#fees) is applied to all Direct Loans, which is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount and deducted from each loan disbursement.\nDirect Subsidized Loans - Undergraduate Students Only \nThese [loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized \"Subsidized Loans\") are offered to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need as determined by the FAFSA, and the amount offered cannot exceed a student's calculated need. The federal government does not charge interest on subsidized loans while you are enrolled at least half-time or during the six-month grace period (see the Loan Repayment section below). These types of loans are only available to students seeking an undergraduate degree.\n**Accepting Loans** : If you accept a Direct Loan, you must complete a [Master Promissory Note](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/subunsub/landing) and [Student Loan Entrance Counseling](https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/) (new borrowers only). You do not have to accept the full amount of the loan that is offered; you can accept a lower amount in WyoRecords. If you decline a loan, it is canceled; however, if you change your mind later, it may be able to be re-offered to you within the same academic year. There are annual and aggregate student loan limits that will determine your eligibility.\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans - Undergraduate and Graduate Students \nThese [loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized) are offered to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, but eligibility is not based on financial need. Interest begins accruing once the loan is disbursed.\n**Accepting Loans** : If you accept a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you must complete a [Master Promissory Note](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/subunsub/landing) and [Student Loan Entrance Counseling](https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/) (new borrowers only). You do not have to accept the full amount of the loan that is offered; you can accept a lower amount in WyoRecords. If you decline a loan, it is canceled; however, if you change your mind later, it may be able to be re-offered to you within the same academic year. There are annual and aggregate student loan limits that will determine your eligibility.\nDirect PLUS Loans for Parents of Undergraduate Students \nThese [loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/parent) may be available to parents of undergraduate students to help pay for expenses not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need, but a credit check will be conducted. Borrowers who have an adverse history must meet additional requirements to qualify.\nThe maximum PLUS loan amount you can borrow is the [Cost of Attendance](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/index.html) minus any other financial assistance they receive at UW. The funds will be applied to the student’s charges, and parents determine who the school pays any credit balance to (the student or themselves). Deferments are available, upon request, while the student is in school and for up to 6 months after.\n**Accepting Loans** : If you as the parent apply for a Direct PLUS Loan, you must complete a [Master Promissory Note](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/parentplus/landing) (new borrowers only).\nDirect PLUS Loans for Graduate or Professional Students \nThese [loans](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/plus/grad) may be available to graduate and professional students to help pay for expenses not covered by other financial aid.

The actual loan amount awarded that you are eligible to receive each academic year may be less than the annual loan limit.\nLoan Repayment \nStudents have a six-month grace period before repayment starts after you graduate, drop below half-time, or leave school entirely. A requirement prior to repayment beginning is to complete [Direct Loan Exit Counseling](https://studentaid.gov/exit-counseling/).\nRepayment and deferment options are available on [FSA's website](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#when-repay). When repayment begins, you will make your payments to the federal government via a [student loan servicer](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/servicers). You can use the [Loan Simulator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/) to estimate your monthly loan repayment amount, and you can also see the different payment plan options.\n## PRivate Student Loans\nThese types of loans are typically considered after you have exhausted other financial aid options, including scholarships, grants, and federal student loans.\n[ExpLore Private loans](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/private-loans.html)\n## Problem Resolution - Ombudsman's Office\nIf you are having a problem related to your loan, and you are unable to resolve that problem successfully with UW, you may contact the Ombudsman’s office in the U.S. Department of Education.

        "url_245": "# Verification\nYour Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) may be randomly selected by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for review in a process called verification. Being selected for the verification process does not mean you did anything wrong - it is a process in which our office must collect documentation from you to verify that the data reported on your FAFSA was entered correctly.\nNavigation [ Main Page ](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa)\nFinancial Aid Forms\n[LEARN MORE](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/forms/index.html)[Secure File Upload](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/forms/upload.html)\n## verification process\nStudents are notified on their WyoRecords Checklist if they are selected for verification. If you are selected for verification, you will be required to submit certain documents and materials to our office so we can review and compare to your FAFSA submission data. See ourFAQ section\nOnce submitted, the specific verification documents will be reviewed. If a document is received incomplete, the status will change from 'Requested' to 'Incomplete' and it will remain on WyoWeb. \nOnce Scholarships & Financial Aid receives all the initial requested documentation, the verification status flag will be changed from 'Requested' to 'In Review'. The status flag will change to 'Complete' once the process is completely done. Students will be notified via email after verification is complete with a message to review their WyoWeb account for adjustments or additions to their financial aid awards. The verification process is indeed a process and can take 2-3 weeks. Please plan accordingly.\nIMPORTANT! Federal aid cannot be offered or disbursed to a student’s account until the verification process has been completed by our office; therefore, you should submit the requested materials as soon as possible and monitor your emails for communications and WyoRecords for your Checklist status updates.\nIn order to receive aid from most federal financial aid programs (including Federal Direct Loans), verification materials must be submitted no later than two weeks before the end of the semester or your last day of attendance for that semester, whichever is earlier. For a Federal Pell Grant, verification documents must be submitted within 120 days after the last day of enrollment for the respective aid year, or by the date published annually by ED in the Federal Register, whichever comes first. Additionally, any required corrections must be submitted to the FAFSA Processing System (FPS) by an earlier deadline which is also published in the Federal Register. \nWhat does this really mean? Simply put, we strongly encourage you to submit your Verification documents without delay following our notification!\n* * *\nVerification Materials\nAny UW verification forms you may need to complete can be found on our [Financial Aid Forms](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/forms/index.html) page.\nAll verification documents and materials, including tax forms, can be submitted to our office using any of the following methods:\n  * Uploaded using our [Secure File Upload](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/forms/upload.html), or\n  * Faxed to us at 307-766-3800, or\n  * Mailed to us at UW Scholarships & Financial Aid, 1000 E University Ave Dept 3335, Laramie, WY 82071, or \n  * Delivered in-person to Knight Hall, Rm 174\n\n\nNote: Make sure to include your W-number on all documents. We do not recommend submitting documents via email if those documents contain personal identifiable information (social security number, date of birth, etc.).\n* * *\nVerification FAQs\nHow will I know if I have been selected for verification? \nYour FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS), provided by the Department of Education, will note if you’ve been selected for verification. Our office will also notify you via email that you have new requirements, and the specific documentation and/or forms requests will be listed on your Requirements section of your Checklist in WyoRecords.\nDo I have to complete the verification process? \nYes. If you have been selected for verification, you will have to turn in the requested documents and materials, and you will have to complete the verification process before you will be able to receive federal and need-based financial aid (if eligible).\nWhat specific documents must I submit to complete verification? \nRequested documents will vary, based upon your individual circumstances, but may include copies of tax returns, tax return transcripts, or Form W-2s; other completed IRS forms; completed institutional forms; personal statements, etc.\nHow do I get my Tax Return Transcript? \nThere are three different methods for requesting your Tax Return Transcript:\n  * Request online by going to[www.IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/). Under Tools, click on the “Get your tax record” link and follow the instructions. Delivery options for an online-requested transcript include electronically* (fastest option) or by mail (takes between 5-10 calendar days). _Be sure to request your tax return transcript rather than a tax account transcript._\n  * You can contact the IRS’ automated phone transcript service by calling 1-800-908-9946. This method may require you to follow prompts and enter the social security number, date of birth, street address, and zip code of the tax filer. Delivery option will be by mail.\n  * A paper form (IRS Form 4506-T) can be completed to request a tax return transcript via the mail (takes between 5-10 calendar days). Delivery option will be by mail.\n\n\n*Requesting the electronic delivery option requires you have (1) access to a valid email address, (2) a text-enabled mobile phone in the user’s name (pay-as-you-go plans cannot be used), and (3) specific financial account numbers (i.e., a credit card number or an account number for a home mortgage or auto loan).\nWhat is the difference between a Tax Return and a Tax Return Transcript? \nYour Tax Return is what you submitted to the IRS, whereas your Tax Return Transcript is created by the IRS and is a record of your tax filing. Your Tax Return Transcript is normally required for the verification process and can only be obtained from the IRS.\nIn lieu of the Tax Return Transcript, you _can_\nWhat do I submit if my taxes were amended? \nIf you filed an amended return (IRS Form 1040X), please also submit a signed copy of your Form 1040X in addition to your IRS Tax Return Transcript. Further information can be found on the [IRS Transcript FAQ page](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript-faqs).\nI was not required to file taxes, so what do I do? \n  * Dependent students who did not file taxes, and were not required to file taxes, must provide a Form W-2 for all sources of income. See the next FAQ below if you can’t find your W-2(s).\n  * Independent students (and spouse, if applicable) who did not file taxes, and were not required to file taxes, must provide a Form W-2 for all sources of income. See the next FAQ below if you can’t find your W-2(s). Additionally you must provide a copy of the Verification of Nonfiling from the IRS. (See the fourth bullet point in this FAQ.)\n  * Parents of dependent students who did not file taxes, and were not required to file taxes, must provide a copy of the Verification of Non-filing Letter from the IRS.\n  * To request a Verification of Nonfiling from the IRS, you either need to request online or by submitting an IRS Form 4506-T. \n    * **Online:** Go to[www.IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/). Under Tools, click on the “Get your tax record” link and follow the instructions, making sure to request your “Verification of Nonfiling”. Requesting online requires you have (1) access to a valid email address, (2) a text-enabled mobile phone in the user’s name (pay-as-you-go plans cannot be used), and (3) specific financial account numbers (i.e., a credit card number or an account number for a home mortgage or auto loan).  _This information is required to confirm your identity?_\n    * **IRS Form 4506-T:** Be sure to complete the top section, check Box 7 for Verification of Nonfiling, note the requested year in Box 9, sign and date the form, and either fax it or mail it to the appropriate location on Page 2, based upon the state you lived in when you filed taxes.\n\n\nWhat should I do if I can't find my Form W-2(s)? \nFirst contact your employer(s) to obtain a copy.\nIf the employer(s) cannot provide a copy, you can obtain a copy from the IRS either online or by submitting an IRS Form 4506-T.\n  * Online: Go to[www.IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/). Under Tools, click on the “Get your tax record” link and following the instructions, making sure to request your “Form W-2”. Requesting online requires you have (1) access to a valid email address, (2) a text-enabled mobile phone in the user’s name (pay-as-you-go plans cannot be used), and (3) specific financial account numbers (i.e., a credit card number or an account number for a home mortgage or auto loan).  _This information is required to confirm your identity?_\n  * IRS Form 4506-T: Be sure to complete the top section, check Box 8 for W-2 request, note the requested year in Box 9, sign and date the form, and either fax it or mail it to the appropriate location on Page 2 based, upon the state you lived in when you filed taxes.\n\n\nWhy am I being asked for prior-prior tax year information? \nBecause each FAFSA is open for a total of 21 months, federal regulations require the form use prior-prior year taxes because taxes for the prior tax year may not be filed yet at the time of FAFSA submission.\nWhy do I have to include other people's information for verification? \n**Spouse** : Per Federal Regulations, the FAFSA requires you to list your marital status as of the date you sign and submit your FAFSA. In addition, federal regulations require you to include spousal income information if you are married as of the date you sign and submit the FAFSA, regardless of whether or not you were married in the tax year used for FAFSA.\n**Parent/Step-parent** : As a dependent student, the FAFSA requires you list the parental information of the parent you lived with more during the 12 months preceding the date you filed the FAFSA*. If that parent is remarried as of the date you filed the FAFSA, you must include your step-parent’s information, even if they were not married to your parent in the tax year used for FAFSA.\n*If you lived with both parents equally, you will include the parent’s (and step- parent’s) information from whom you received more financial support in the past 12 months preceding the date you filed the FAFSA.\nWhen do I need to turn in my verification materials? \nIn order to receive some types of aid, most financial aid programs (including Federal Direct Loans) require that verification documents must be submitted no later than**two weeks** prior to the last day of the term or your last day of attendance for that term, whichever is earlier. \nFor a Federal Pell Grant, verification documents must be submitted within**120 days**\nSimply put, we strongly encourage you to submit your documents without delay!\nHow do I submit the necessary verification materials? \nSee the [Verification Materials](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html#verification-materials) section of this page for methods to submit your verification documents and materials. Include any Tax Return Transcripts or Forms W-2 that you have requested/received from the IRS, through any delivery method listed.\nHow long will it take for my verification to be processed? \nGenerally, the verification process takes 2-3 weeks once you submit all the requested documents and materials, depending on peak processing times. Incomplete files cannot be verified, so the verification process will not begin until all required items have been received and are fully completed.\nHow do I check on the status of the verification process? \nEach specific verification document will be reviewed by our staff upon submission. If a document is received incomplete, the status flag will change from “Requested” to “Incomplete”, and it will remain on WyoRecords as an outstanding requirement.\nOnce our office receives all requested and completed documentation, the verification status flag in WyoRecords will be changed from “Requested” to “In Review”. The status flag will change to “Complete” once the verification process is finalized by our staff. \nStudents will be notified via email after verification is finalized with a message to review your WyoRecords account for adjustments or additions to your financial aid awards.\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

To help you understand how the University of Wyoming calculates its cost of attendance for students, we've put together some information based on our estimates.\nAll costs displayed on this page are _estimates_ and are subject to change and/or approval by the UW Board of Trustees.\nResidency \n  * Wyoming Resident - a student who graduated from a high school in the state of Wyoming or a student who has established residency for tuition purposes, as determined by the Office of the Registrar, will be considered a Wyoming resident student.  \n  \n\n  * Non-Resident & International - a student who is not a resident of the state of Wyoming will be considered a non-resident or international student.  \n  \n\n  * Alumni - a student who is an out-of-state resident, with either parent having graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, or a student who graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, will qualify for the Children of Alumni tuition benefit.\n\n\nTuition & Fees \n  * Based on a block tuition rate for undergraduate students enrolled in 12-18 credit hours per semester. If enrolled in more or less than the block rate, tuition will adjust accordingly.  \n  \n\n  * Fees include mandatory, advising, and program. They are applied dependent on enrollment status and courses taken. Advising fees are $10 per credit hour and program fees vary between $3 and $26 per credit hour.

This is optional at UW but know that a completed FAFSA is necessary to determine your eligibility for any federal and/or need-based aid. Completing the FAFSA requires providing financial information for all FAFSA contributors (you, your spouse, your biological or adoptive parent, and/or your parent's spouse); however, completing the FAFSA  _does not_ lock anyone into enrolling in college or taking on student debt.\n  * Be a U.S. citizen or eligible [noncitizen](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens). UW does have some [institutional scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/international/index.html) available for international students.\n  * Have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent. This includes a [home school credit evaluation](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/_files/docs/homeschoolcreditevaluation.pdf) or a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.\n  * Take either the ACT or SAT standardized test. A test-optional preference is available for institutional scholarships or Commitments, but a standardized test score may help boost your eligibility.  _A standardized test score is still a requirement for Wyoming high school graduates to be considered for the Hathaway Scholarship_.\n  * Be enrolled at UW in a degree-seeking program.\n  * Be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours (half-time enrollment) for federal aid as an undergraduate. Notes: Graduate students need to be enrolled in at least 4.5 credit hours to qualify.\n  * Be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours for scholarships or Commitments when an undergraduate. \n  * Do not have federal loans in excess of the annual or aggregate limits of the federal aid program.\n  * Do not have reached your LEU (lifetime eligibility used) for the Pell Grant.\n  * Do not be in default on any federal student loan(s) or owe money on a federal grant.\n  * All continuing students receiving federal aid must be making [satisfactory academic progress](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/sap/index.html) (SAP) towards a degree.\n\n\n* * *\nWhat is the FAFSA?\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form that allows our office to determine a student's eligibility for several types of financial aid including:\n  * Federal Pell Grant\n  * Federal SEOG Grant\n  * Federal Work-Study Program\n  * State-funded Hathaway need-based scholarship\n  * Institutionally-funded grants\n  * Federal Direct Subsidized Loan\n  * Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan\n  * Federal Parent PLUS Loan\n\n\n**Who should complete the FAFSA?** Although not required, all students should consider completing and submitting a FAFSA each year, even if you think you won't qualify for financial aid, so you don't leave any money on the table. Completing the FAFSA does not lock anyone into enrolling in college or taking on student debt, but it does ensure that you make a major life decision with full knowledge of the money you're entitled to! A basic assumption the federal government makes, when determining federal aid eligibility, is that parents of dependent students - as well as the student, themselves - have the primary responsibility to pay for their education. Submitting the FAFSA does not obligate parents to pay for college, but it does require a parent to provide financial information in order to fully determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. Dependent students who do not qualify grants or Work-Study are usually eligible to borrow a federal student loan to help pay for their education.\n**How do you determine your dependency status for the FAFSA?** Your dependency status determines whether your parents' information will be required or not for the completion of the FAFSA. If you are a dependent student, it doesn't mean your parents are required to pay for your education, but the information is used to determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Your answers to [certain questions](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency) on the FAFSA will determine your status.\n**How often do you complete the FAFSA?** The FAFSA needs to be completed each year because it uses a new tax year each time. The form is open for 21 months each cycle, so it uses the \"prior-prior\" tax year. The FAFSA normally opens on October 1 each year, and students must complete it by the earlier of June 30 of that  _academic year_ or their last day of their enrollment in the academic year. For example, a new first-time student starting in the fall could complete the FAFSA beginning the October of their senior year in high school, and they have until June 30 following their first year in college.\n**What happens after you submit the FAFSA?** After your FAFSA has been submitted and processed, a FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) will be created. If you provided a valid email address when completing the FAFSA, you will receive an email with instructions to access the FSS online. If your FAFSA didn't have a valid email address, you will receive a paper FSS in the mail. The FSS will indicate if there are actions required or if the FAFSA is complete. Additionally, it will:\n  * summarize the information you and your contributors included on the FAFSA,\n  * provide estimated eligibility for federal student loans and grants,\n  * and provide the calculated Student Aid Index (SAI) which is a number calculated by the Department of Education based upon your FAFSA components such as income and assets. Our office uses the SAI to determine how much federal aid and need-based aid you qualify for. It is intended to represent your family's financial strength and ability to pay for college.\n\n\n**What about mistakes on the FAFSA?** If you find a mistake when reviewing your FSS, you will need to login to [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) and correct your FAFSA form. To learn more about the FSS, visit the [Federal Student Aid website](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/v/apply-for-aid/fafsa/review-and-correct/fafsa-submission-summary).\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmEP38x-1Z8) provides some basic information about the FAFSA.\n* * *\nHow to Apply for Aid\nStudents will be evaluated for merit scholarships through the application process at the University of Wyoming. If you want to be considered for federal financial aid, as well as any need-based aid (federal, state, or institutional), you will need to complete the FAFSA (Steps 1 and 2 below).\nStep 1 - Create FSA ID\nCreate a Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) on [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) if you haven't already. Also have your FAFSA contributor(s) create their FSA ID(s). The FSA ID, also known as the Federal Student Aid ID, is a unique username and password that acts as your digital signature to access and manage your FAFSA and other aspects of federal financial aid. A contributor could be a spouse, a parent, or a stepparent, and they will use the same FSA ID for all their children's education journey.\nStep 2 - Submit FAFSA\nComplete and submit the FAFSA online. **UW's school code is 003932** ; if you do not include it on your FAFSA, UW will not receive your FAFSA information and cannot process your FAFSA.\nSince the FAFSA uses a new tax year each year, you and your FAFSA contributors should plan on submitting the form annually for each new academic year.\nStudents complete the Student section of the FAFSA and they invite contributors to complete their section(s). The student and contributors will be required to provide consent to have their federal tax information released from the IRS, even if a tax return was not filed. After all contributors have consented and signed the form, it will be submitted for processing. For online FAFSA submissions, a confirmation will be sent at the time confirming successful submission.\nAfter submission, your FAFSA typically takes 2-3 business days to process. Be sure to log back into your account on [studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/) to review your FAFSA Submission Summary and confirm that nothing has been flagged for follow-up.\n_FAFSA Hints:_\n  * _When creating your FSA ID, make sure your email address is entered correctly._\n  * _Be sure your social security number is also entered accurately before submitting the FAFSA. This is used by the U.S. Department of Education and UW to match and process your FAFSA. Entering it incorrectly will result in an error that can cause significant delays._\n  * _To determine who needs to be a contributor on your FAFSA, use this[handy work-flow](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info) to determine which parent(s) should create a FSA ID and provide information on your FAFSA. Generally speaking, the parent who provided the most financial support over the past 12 months will be listed as a FAFSA contributor._\n  * _The FAFSA asks about family size. Your response should include individuals who meet specific support and relationship criteria for the award year[as defined by the Internal Revenue Code](https://studentaid.gov/2526/help/family-size)._\n  * _When completing the income section, if a question does not apply to you (or your contributor), enter a zero (0). Leaving questions blank can result in processing delays._\n  * _For asset information, not all students (or your contributor[s]) are required to report assets on the FAFSA. The application will guide you based on your situation and your previous answers. If you don't have any assets to report and the questions don't not apply to you, enter a zero (0). Leaving questions blank can result in processing delays._\n  * _Before you submit your FAFSA, be sure to carefully look over the review page that summarizes all your responses. If you notice any mistakes, correcting them before submitting the form is always the preferred practice._\n\n\nStep 3 - Access WyoScholarships\nComplete the General Application in [WyoScholarships](https://uwyo.academicworks.com/), our scholarship platform. This will finalize your eligibility to receive a renewing Commitment or Award if you originally qualified for one, as well as the actual scholarships that will fulfill that Commitment amount.\nAfter completing the General Application in WyoScholarships, you can review any recommended scholarships requiring applications if you meet the criteria. If you have been awarded a Commitment, any scholarship that you apply for, and receive, will usually help fulfill the Commitment amount.\nStep 4 - Review Requirements and Submit Documentation\nNavigate to [WyoWeb](https://wyoweb.uwyo.edu/) and login to WyoRecords using the 'Students' link and review your Checklist for the current aid year _Requirements_. Monitor your UWYO email and Checklist regularly for notifications from our office. There may be requirements you need to satisfy or documents you need to submit to our office to verify data before we can provide your financial aid package. That includes any students who have been selected for [FAFSA verification](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html).\nIf you have submitted a FAFSA, there will be three requirements for Title IV (federal) aid to complete on your Checklist. The intent of each requirement is based upon if a student might ever have more federal financial aid than they have charges in any given semester. These can be a little tricky, so the table below will provide our suggestions.\n**Title IV Charges Authorization** | **Prior Year Charges Authorization** | **Hold Title IV Credit Balances Authorization**  \n---|---|---  \n**If you ACCEPT:** Non-standard  _current year charges_ will be paid for with any excess federal financial aid. |  **If you ACCEPT:** Non-standards  _prior year charges_ will be paid with excess federal financial aid for the current aid year. |  **If you ACCEPT:** Excess federal financial aid will be held by UW for charges in a future semester. Excess monies will finally be refunded to you towards the end of spring semester of that aid year.  \n**If you DECLINE:** Those charges will remain on your student account and must be paid. |  **If you DECLINE:**  _Prior year charges_ will remain on your account and must be paid. |  **If you DECLINE:** You will control any excess aid amount yourself and can choose to apply it to charges in a future semester.  \nYou only have to submit your preferences for these authorizations once as a student, but you can go back and adjust them anytime and then resubmit.\nWhat to do Next?\n**Monitor your email** - Our office will notify you by email (your UWYO email account) about the status of your financial aid throughout your time at UW.\n**Submit required documents** - If notify you that you have been selected for [FAFSA verification](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html), be sure to submit all requested documentation as soon as possible so the disbursement of your financial aid isn't negatively impacted.\n**Review aid package** - Once you have been packaged with financial aid offers, you will receive an email from our office. Log into [WyoWeb > WyoRecords > 'Students link'](https://wyoweb.uwyo.edu/) to access your Checklist for the current aid year _Awards._ Beginning each March, you will be able to accept or decline federal student loan offers and/or Work-Study awards (if eligible) that you have received for the upcoming academic year. Note: Federal Pell Grants and SEOG Grants are loaded as 'accepted', so no further action is required.\n**Complete donor thank you letters** - Although students no longer need to accept the scholarship that fulfill their Commitments, we still encourage you to watch for email prompts from [WyoScholarships](https://uwyo.academicworks.com/) so you can complete thank you letters to the generous donors who provide scholarship funds. Without their support, it would be more difficult for our students to pay for college!\n[Return to Top of Page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/index.html#top-of-page)\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

Some forms of aid are also based upon full-time enrollment.\n_Fun Fact: the word ‘consortium’ is pronounced “kuhn-**sawr** -shee-uhm”. It sounds French, but it is derived from Latin origination and means partner or partnership!_\n[Consortium Agreement Form](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/_files/docs/consortium-agreement-new-2025.pdf)\n## Cards Carousel Slider\n### How it Works\nLearn more about how a consortium agreement functions.\n[More Info](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/consortium-agreement.html#how-it-works)\n### Minimum Requirements\nLearn more about how to qualify for a consortium agreement.\n[more info](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/consortium-agreement.html#minimum-requirements)\n### Timing Considerations\nLearn more about the timing of a consortium agreement.\n[more info](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/consortium-agreement.html#timing-considerations)\n## How it Works\nIn a consortium agreement, there is a HOME and a HOST institution. The home institution is where you will receive your degree. The other institution(s) is referred to as a host institution. Not all schools participate in consortium agreements, so check with the host school first before you begin the process.\nConsortium agreements are semester-specific, so a new agreement is required each time you wish to combine enrollment between institutions. Your [Cost of Attendance](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/index.html) (COA) will be adjusted based on the actual tuition and fees at all schools, and it may be reduced if costs at the host institution are lower.\nFinancial aid will disburse after the UW Drop Period ends or once your host school enrollment is confirmed - whichever is later. You are responsible for paying your host institution on time, even if UW aid has not yet disbursed; you may need to use personal funds initially.\n* * *\nMinimum Requirements\nYou must be admitted to each institution and be degree-seeking, and you must be enrolled for a minimum of six (6) credit hours at UW for that semester, except in the following situations:\n  * Students in the ReNEW nursing program or the Medical Technology program\n  * Students enrolled in summer semester\n\n\nEven if you're enrolled in 12 or more hours at UW, which is considered full-time, it's always a good idea to complete a consortium agreement if you're also enrolled elsewhere. Without a consortium agreement in place, we cannot consider any successfully completed hours at a host institution when determining your ongoing eligibility for federal or scholarship aid. So, think of it as an insurance policy! However, you should understand that enrollment in more than 12 hours total will not result in your federal aid, or scholarship aid, being increased.\nCoursework taken at a host institution must be transferrable to UW and be a part of your degree's required curriculum, and your academic advisor must approve each course taken at a host institution.\nNo Work-Study monies awarded by UW will be available for Work-Study positions at a host institution.\nAt the end of each semester, you must request any host institution to send a final transcript to UW Admissions and Registrar. Your financial aid for the next semester may be withheld or placed on a 'pending' status until your academic record has been reviewed to determine whether you meet ongoing eligibility requirements.\n* * *\nTiming Considerations\nTo be considered for a consortium agreement, students must submit a fully completed form - signed by your UW advisor - at least 30 days before the first day of UW's classes for the relevant semester. Processing may take up to 10 business days after submission, as it requires approval from both the Registrar and our office.\nConsortium agreements cannot be approved retroactively, meaning UW cannot process agreements for courses taken in previous semesters.\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

If a student is eligible to receive the need-based Hathaway Scholarship as well, it can also be used for this purpose.\nExternal Scholarships\nStudents are encouraged to look for scholarship opportunities funded by organizations external of UW to help pay for their study abroad experience.

To help you understand how the University of Wyoming calculates its cost of attendance for students, we've put together some information based on our estimates.\nAll costs displayed on this page are _estimates_ and are subject to change and/or approval by the UW Board of Trustees.\nResidency \n  * Wyoming Resident - a student who graduated from a high school in the state of Wyoming or a student who has established residency for tuition purposes, as determined by the Office of the Registrar, will be considered a Wyoming resident student.  \n  \n\n  * Non-Resident & International - a student who is not a resident of the state of Wyoming will be considered a non-resident or international student.  \n  \n\n  * Alumni - a student who is an out-of-state resident, with either parent having graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, or a student who graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, will qualify for the Children of Alumni tuition benefit.\n\n\nTuition & Fees \n  * Standard online undergraduate programs are based on a block tuition rate for students enrolled in 12-18 credit hours per semester. If enrolled in more or less than the block rate, tuition will adjust accordingly.  \n  \n\n  * Online undergraduate and graduate programs are based on a non-block tuition rate, dependent upon residency status and enrollment requirements that are determined by the length of program.  \n  \n\n  * Mandatory fees include distance delivery, student services, and advising. They are applied dependent on enrollment status. Some programs may incur additional fees which are included on the appropriate COA grid. Distance delivery fees are $14 per credit hour, student fees are $35 per credit hour, and advising fees are $10 per credit hour (undergraduate only). Note: All  _first-time undergraduate and transfer students_ will incur a $150 Onboarding Fee during their first semester of enrollment; this is not included in our Fees estimate above but should be considered for students within those populations.  \n  \n\n  * See our [Tuition and Fees](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/tuition-and-fees.html \"Go to the Tuition and Fees page.\") page for more information.\n\n\nLiving Expense \n  * A housing allowance for students who live off-campus is based on an average of student survey, UW apartments, and publicly reported county housing data for one bedroom living arrangements, including utility expenses.  \n  \n\n  * A housing allowance for students who live at home with parents is based on a percentage of the off-campus costs.  \n  \n\n  * A food allowance that provides the average of student survey data and publicly reported county grocery data for students who life off-campus or at home.\n\n\nBooks, Course Materials, Supplies & Equipment \n  * An estimate based on student survey data and national data.\n\n\nOther Expenses \n  * Transportation - an estimate based on an average of transportation expenses by our peer institutions.  \n  \n\n  * Miscellaneous Personal Expenses - an estimated based on student survey data and may include laundry and dry cleaning, personal hygiene items, personal grooming, necessary clothing, shoes, and entertainment.\n\n\n## Online Student Resources\n### Get Assistance\nUW Online & Continued Education is a dedicated team meant to help you with your journey to earning your degree.

During that same 2022 legislative session, the WY legislature allocated $1.25M to \"kickstart\" scholarships with the same WTS student eligibility criteria and named it \"Kickstart Wyoming's Tomorrow Scholarship\" (KWTS) in an effort to support students during the WTS endowment's corpus maturity phase. In March 2024, the 2024 Legislative Session contributed the remaining funds to reach the mandated $50M WTS endowment corpus necessary to authorize student scholarship dividends beginning in the 2025-2026 academic year. During the same 2024 legislative session, an additional $2.5M was allocated to prolong KWTS awards until the 2025-26 award year begins for the WTS award disbursement. Once all legislatively appropriated KWTS funds are exhausted, KWTS awards shall be discounted and only scholarships awarded from the WTS endowment dividend shall remain in effect. Per Wyoming Legislature 2024 Session Laws, Chapter 118, Section 327(c) (page #355), a student who receives KWTS may be eligible for WTS if the student has not exhausted the equivalent of four (4) full-time academic terms or a total of seven thousand two hundred dollars ($7,200.00) in scholarships for unmet financial need.\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

Financial aid awards are subject to adjustments or cancellations due to changes in law, regulations, appropriations, changes in your financial situation, verification, the discovery of data errors, changes in enrollment status, an over-award situation, or changes in residency, amongst others.\nOSFA communicates with students by email. You are responsible for monitoring your @uwyo.edu account and checking it regularly. Additionally, you are responsible for managing your financial aid, so be sure to check WyoRecords frequently in terms of your aid and your student account.\nThe acceptance of awards and/or the receipt of an electronic or check refund indicates my acknowledgment of my awards' terms and conditions. Furthermore, such acceptance also indicates that I will certify that I will use any money under the federally assisted loans, grants, or work-study programs only for educational expenses.\nFAFSA \n  * [Completion of the FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid) must be completed __each aid year__ , and it is required to determine if you are eligible to receive any federal aid and/or need-based aid.\n  * There is a 21-month window for completing the FAFSA for each aid year. That means two aid years may be open concurrently, so be careful to choose the correct aid year when completing the FAFSA.\n  * Federal law prohibits a student from receiving financial aid at two schools simultaneously.\n\n\nVerification \n  * The verification process is used to validate certain information you entered on your FAFSA. If you are selected for verification by the federal processor or by the university, you will be required to submit additional documentation to confirm the accuracy of the data on the FAFSA. If your FAFSA is corrected based on this information, your award(s) may be revised.\n  * The verification process takes, on average, about two (2) weeks, but it can take longer during peak months and depending upon your specific situation.\n  * Some of your financial aid will not be awarded/disbursed until verification has been completed.\n\n\nCost of Attendance (COA) \n  * [Cost of Attendance (COA)](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/index.html) is an estimate designed to help students determine what it may cost to attend UW for an academic year. COA, sometimes referred to as a “budget,” is not a final bill but an estimate of educational expenses.\n  * COA usually represents the maximum amount of financial assistance a student can receive in an academic year.\n  * If you enroll less than full-time, your COA will be reduced to reflect your enrollment status, and award amounts may be adjusted accordingly.\n\n\nSatisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) \n  * SAP is defined as the successful completion of coursework toward an eligible certificate or degree. Federal regulations require OSFA to monitor the academic progress of students receiving federal financial aid.\n  * SAP is evaluated before each disbursement period. Students with denied SAP appeals will be ineligible to receive federal financial aid and possibly some scholarships during that period.\n  * See our [SAP page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/sap/index.html) for the policy and FAQs.\n\n\nEnrollment Requirements \n  * Eligibility for financial aid is based upon your FAFSA results and/or the following enrollment requirements:  Enrollment Requirements  \n---  \n12 Credit Hour Minimum | 9 Credit Hour Minimum | 6 Credit Hour Minimum (half-time status for graduate students is 4.5 hours) | Pro-rated for less than 12 Credit Hours  \nUndergraduate: Most institutional scholarships require FT undergraduate hours per semester | Graduate: Most institutional scholarships require FT graduate hours per semester (usually 9) | Federal loans | Federal Pell Grant  \nState Hathaway Scholarship (it can be received as graduate student, but undergraduate requirements are used). It can be received for <12 hours at a pro-rated amount, but a minimum of 6 hours is necessary to receive any funds. |  | Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) | State Hathaway Scholarship and Grant  \n|  | Federal Work Study |   \n\n\n  * If you do not enroll in fall semester, your initial award(s) will be canceled and you will be re-awarded if you enroll in the spring. This may result in a change of previously awarded aid funds, specifically some scholarships.\n\n\nRequired Attendance \n  * Enrolling in courses is not enough to secure your financial aid; you must also attend the courses in which you enroll. OSFA must verify that students who receive a non-passing grade (any grade other than A, B, C, D, or S) in any class the student actually began attending. If you receive a non-passing grade in a course or no grade is reported, we will follow up with your professor to determine whether or not you attended and if your aid must be reduced.\n\n\nChanges in Enrollment Status \n  * Changes in your enrollment status (a change in residency status, dropping/withdrawing from courses, adding additional courses, doing an all-school withdrawal, or changing majors) could result in adjustments to financial aid. Such adjustments may result in you needing to repay those funds.\n  * Federal regulations require that students who complete an all-school withdrawal may only keep the federal financial aid they have earned up to the withdrawal time.\n  * If you are considering changes to your enrollment status, it is important to discuss your situation thoroughly with a financial aid advisor in our office before doing so.\n\n\nSummer Semester \n  * To be eligible for federal summer financial aid, you must complete the application after registering for summer courses.\n  * Aid for the summer semester will be disbursed on the first day of your first class.\n\n\nSources of Financial Aid \nStudent Loans\n  * A loan is money you borrow and must pay back with interest.\n  * Several different [loan types](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans) are available to students through the U.S. Department of Education.\n  * Loans amounts are limited by your year in school and could be less than [the annual loan limit](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#how-much-can-i-borrow) depending upon your other aid.\n  * If you accept a federal loan, you will need to complete a [Master Promissory Note (MPN)](https://studentaid.gov/mpn/) and [entrance counseling](https://studentaid.gov/entrance-counseling/). Likewise, if your parent accepts a federal PLUS loan on your behalf, they will need to complete an MPN.\n  * Loans must be accepted before the end of the academic term in which you are enrolled.\n  * Repayment starts six months after a student ceases to be enrolled at least half-time (6 credit hours). At that time, you will need to complete [exit counseling](https://studentaid.gov/exit-counseling/).\n\n\nFederal Work-Study (FWS)\n  * [FWS](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study) is a need-based program that provides employment opportunities to eligible students (undergraduate and graduate) to help meet their college education costs.\n  * The award amount in WyoRecords is an estimate of potential earnings and is contingent upon available jobs and actual hours worked.\n  * FWS funds are not disbursed to your student account and do not reduce the amount you may owe UW. Instead, you receive a pay-check based on hours worked. Direct deposit is available based on the biweekly payroll calendar that can be located via: [www.uwyo.edu/hr.](https://www.uwyo.edu/hr/)\n\n\nPell Grants\n  * Pell Grants are need-based grants given to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need and have not received a baccalaureate degree. The amount you can receive depends on your financial need, cost of attendance, full- or part-time status, and your plans to attend school for the full academic year or less.\n  * Federal law limits the amount of Pell that students can receive over their lifetime.\n\n\nScholarships\n  * Scholarships – UW has many [institutional scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/index.html) as both merit and need-based aid. Some scholarships require an application, and others are awarded to students who meet specific criteria established by the donor(s).\n  * Commitments – will be awarded as “Pending Fulfillment,” which means that the money UW has committed to you is a place-holder and will be fulfilled with individual scholarships. You will need to complete the WyoScholarships General Application to fulfill your commitment. You will be notified at your UW email when your commitment is fulfilled. Your commitment status will change to “Fulfilled” and be replaced with individual scholarships in an “Offered” status. Please make sure to follow the steps outlined in the email notification to ensure you accept and/or complete a thank you letter(s) to the donors who fulfilled your commitment.\n  * Hathaway Scholarship – this state scholarship is awarded by UW Admissions to eligible Wyoming high school graduates, and then it is administered by our office. If you have transferred from a Wyoming community college, you will need to provide a Hathaway Transfer Transcript to our office.\n  * Renewable Scholarships – some scholarships can be renewed if [ongoing eligibility requirements](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/index.html) are met. These requirements are reviewed following each spring semester.\n  * [External Scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/external-scholarships.html) – these are funds you receive from outside sources that are processed and loaded into your student account through our office. These funds count towards your COA.\n  * WyoScholarships – most scholarship awarding occurs within [WyoScholarships](https://uwyo.academicworks.com/), our scholarship platform. You need to complete the general application each year, accept any scholarship that you have received, and complete a donor thank you letter if prompted.\n  * If you leave UW through transfer, graduation, or any other form of leave, you may not be entitled to the remaining eligibility of institutional aid/scholarships and will forfeit such remaining eligibility.\n\n\nCompletion of Title IV \n  * On your financial aid checklist, you may complete your Title IV designation. This allows you to choose to have excess federal financial aid pay charges on your student account related to a prior term, future term, or charges other than tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board.\n\n\nDisbursement of Financial Aid \n  * Aid will generally be disbursed to your student account beginning 24 hours after the Drop Period ends each semester (fall and spring).\n  * You are required to pay any remaining balance due on your student account each semester. Students with unpaid balances will have a hold placed on their account, precluding them from enrolling for the next semester.\n  * If you received more aid than you have charges, you will receive a refund. The Student Financial Services' office processes these refunds either in [electronic or check format,](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/refunds.html) or held and applied to the following semester.\n  * Following the refund period, any subsequent charges to your student account are your responsibility to pay.\n\n\nConsortium Agreements \n  * Students may combine credit hours between two or more institutions to maintain full-time status for financial aid. See our [ Consortium Agreement ](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/consortium-agreement.html) page for more details and the actual agreement.\n\n\nStudy Abroad \n  * Students participating in study abroad programs should meet with our office to verify if there are any restrictions to receiving any of your financial aid for that semester.\n  * Students who can demonstrate costs greater than COA, and provide documentation of those costs, can request a COA appeal for the impacted semester.\n  * Study abroad students must be enrolled in a UW 4001 level study abroad course (an exchange program) with tuition billed by UW for institutional scholarships to pay. If you enroll in a non-exchange program, you will waive that semester of institutional scholarship eligibility.\n\n\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

To help you understand how the University of Wyoming calculates its cost of attendance for students, we've put together some information based on our estimates.\nAll costs displayed on this page are _estimates_ and are subject to change and/or approval by the UW Board of Trustees.\nResidency \n  * Wyoming Resident - a student who graduated from a high school in the state of Wyoming or a student who has established residency for tuition purposes, as determined by the Office of the Registrar, will be considered a Wyoming resident student.  \n  \n\n  * Non-Resident & International - a student who is not a resident of the state of Wyoming will be considered a non-resident or international student.  \n  \n\n  * Alumni - a student who is an out-of-state resident, with either parent having graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, or a student who graduated with a degree from the University of Wyoming, will qualify for the Children of Alumni tuition benefit.\n\n\nTuition & Fees \n  * Standard graduate programs are based on a block tuition rate for students enrolled in 9 credit hours per semester. If enrolled in more or less than the block rate, tuition will adjust accordingly.  \n  \n\n  * Other graduate programs are based on a non-block tuition rate, dependent upon residency status, and enrollment requirements that are determined by the length of program. The on-campus MBA program charges all students, regardless of residency status, the same non-block tuition rate.  \n  \n\n  * Mandatory fees are applied dependent on enrollment status. Some programs may incur additional fees, which are included on the appropriate COA grid.  \n  \n\n  * See our [Tuition and Fees](https://www.uwyo.edu/fsbo/student-financial-services/tuition-and-fees.html \"Go to the Tuition and Fees page.\") page for more information.\n\n\nLiving Expense \n  * A housing allowance for students who live on-campus is based on an average of all dorm living arrangements. See [On-Campus Housing page](https://www.uwyo.edu/living/dining/index.html \"Go to the On-Campus Housing page.\") for more information..  \n  \n\n  * A housing allowance for students who live off-campus is based on an average of student survey, UW apartments, and publicly reported county housing data for one bedroom living arrangements, including utility expenses.  \n  \n\n  * A housing allowance for students who live at home with parents is based on a percentage of the off-campus costs.  \n  \n\n  * A food allowance that provides the equivalent of three meals each day is based on the unlimited meal plan for students who live on-campus. For students who live off-campus or at home, it is the average of student survey data and publicly reported county grocery data. See [Dining page](https://www.uwyo.edu/living/dining/index.html \"Go to the Dining page.\") for more information.\n\n\nBooks, Course Materials, Supplies & Equipment \n  * An estimate based on national data and access to StartRight+, which is a digital first course material program that provides graduate students convenient, affordable, day-one access to all course materials for one flat rate. See [University Store](https://www.uwyo.edu/enterprises/startright/index.html \"Go to the University Store StartRight+ page.\") page for more information about StartRight+.\n\n\nOther Expenses \n  * Transportation - an estimate based on an average of transportation expenses by our peer institutions.  \n  \n\n  * Miscellaneous Personal Expenses - an estimated based on student survey data and may include laundry and dry cleaning, personal hygiene items, personal grooming, necessary clothing, shoes, and entertainment.\n\n\n## Graduate Student Resources\n### Graduate Assistantships\nMany of our graduate programs at UW offer students a generous assistantship stipend to help cover the cost of attending UW.\n[More Information](https://www.uwyo.edu/uwgrad/enrolled-students/financial-assistance/assistantship-funding.html \"Go to the Graduate Education Graduate Assistantship Information page.\")\n### Search Programs\nUW offers over 80 graduate programs with prestigious research opportunities that can open doors across your field of study.\n[Search Programs](https://www.uwyo.edu/uw/degree-programs/index.html \"Go to the UW Degree Programs search page.\")\n### New Graduate Students\nFind all the information you need to get started at UW after you've been admitted to your graduate program.\n[New Student Info](https://www.uwyo.edu/uwgrad/enrolled-students/new-students.html \"Go to the New Graduate Students page.\")\n## COA Adjustments\nIf your expenses are not accurately reflected in the COA, you may [appeal](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/financial-aid-appeals/index.html \"Go to the Financial Aid Appeals page.\") for an adjustment for one or more of the following reasons:\n  * Child care expenses incurred while the student and/or spouse are at school or work.\n  * Cost of a personal laptop or computer for educational purposes.\n  * Unusual medical/dental expenses, not covered by insurance and not itemized on tax returns.\n  * Approved University of Wyoming study abroad programs.\n  * Costs related to a disability.\n  * Additional required program fees and expenses.\n\n\nNet Price Calculator\nAs you consider your options for college, it's important that you consider the Net Price - the difference between estimated COA and the actual scholarships and grants you qualify for. That number is your estimated out-of-pocket cost for a year.\n[Estimate your net price](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator.html \"Go to the Cost of Attendance Calculator page.\")\n_Note : The estimate provided using the net price calculator does not represent a final determination or actual offer of financial assistance.

the University of Wyoming must be admitted for the current or upcoming semester.

If you decide to move forward with deferral, submit a [deferral request form](https://uwyo-erx.my.salesforce-sites.com/leads/apex/ERx_Forms__PageMaker?pageId=Deferment). Then, confirm the deferral with the admissions office. \nThis is an important decision.

Students must apply for these opportunities again based on their new entry term.\nWhat happens to my enrollment deposit after deferment? \nStudents will forfeit any enrollment deposit paid and not refunded prior to the published deadlines for the semester for which they were originally admitted.\nHow do I re-enroll after deferment? \nStudents ready to re-enroll after deferment are required to provide final, official transcripts from any schools attended since last applying for admission. \nWhat information must be disclosed after deferment? \nStudents wishing to re-enroll are required to notify the Admissions Office, in writing, regarding felony and/or behavioral suspensions which occurred since last applying for admission.\nWho to contact with further questions? \nReach out to UW Office of Admissions, for any further questions regarding deferred enrollment, a deferral request or steps to enrolling after deferment. \n## Contact Us\n### UW Office of Admissions\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 150\n  * 1000 E.

Our campus is tucked right in at the base of the Snowy Mountains and is full of exciting things to do! Of course, we recommend grabbing a beverage or snack at our [on-campus coffee shops](https://www.uwyo.edu/living/dining/dining-hours.html) or playing a game of billiards at the [Pokes Pub & Gameroom](https://www.uwyo.edu/union/pokes-pub-and-gameroom/index.html), but Laramie has so much to offer!  \n  \nBe sure to explore our bustling downtown ([voted one of the top 3 main streets in the nation!](https://mainstreet.org/our-network/awards-and-recognition/great-american-main-street-awards/laramie-wyoming)) and maybe even get in a little outdoor recreation at our many nearby forest and mountain areas. Discover all the reasons the locals call Laramie, Laradise.\n[Visit Laramie](https://www.uwyo.edu/uw/aboutuw/about-laramie.html)\n## What to Bring for Your Visit to Laramie\n[Laramie weather](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/b5f629e4a418e4bb39b77f5f1206ae1a2c0748e25d00b770198262f0d75f415e) can be a bit unpredictable, so it’s best to dress in layers. In winter, be ready for snow, while summer is likely to bring some sun—don’t forget sunscreen and a water bottle! Comfortable shoes are a must, especially for walking around campus. It’s always a good idea to check the weather the day before your visit so you can pack accordingly and make the most of your time on campus.\n[Laramie Conditions](https://wyoroad.info/pls/Browse/WRR.TownResults?SelectedTown=Laramie)\n## Contact Us\n### UW Campus Visitor Center\nRoss Hall\n  * 1000 E.

Most college-level courses from regionally accredited schools transfer, while remedial and vocational courses typically do not. Your prior GPA determines admission and scholarships, but once at UW, only your UW courses affect your GPA. Your department decides how transfer credits apply to your major and whether \"D\" grades count.

Your credits won’t be evaluated until your admission file is complete and you’ve been accepted. Since this process takes time, early submission helps avoid delays. Once the Office of the Registrar reviews your transcripts, you’ll receive an email with instructions on how to check your transfer credits in WyoRecords through WyoWeb. For more details, visit the [UW Registrar’s Office](https://www.uwyo.edu/registrar/index.html) and use the [Wyoming Transfer Catalog ](https://wyossb.uwyo.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/uw.TransferCatalog?_gl=1*71d797*_gcl_au*MTMwMjAxODQ3OS4xNzQ0NjQyNzM1*_ga*OTA3ODQxNzMxLjE3MzY3OTIzODM.*_ga_DCJG3HESYS*czE3NTAxOTczNDUkbzI5NiRnMSR0MTc1MDE5ODI1NyRqNTgkbDAkaDA.)for an unofficial credit evaluation.\n## More About Trasnferring Credit to UW\nEasily transfer your credits to UW! Whether you're coming from a community college, a four-year university, or even military training, we’ll help you maximize your prior coursework. Explore how your credits apply and get on track toward your UW degree.\nWill my credits transfer from a Wyoming community college? \nYes! Wyoming community colleges use a common course numbering system, so most courses transfer directly to UW with the same course equivalency and University Studies Program (USP) credit. If a course doesn’t have a direct equivalent, it may transfer as general elective credit. Advisors can also approve substitutions when appropriate.\nWhat if I’m transferring from an out-of-state community college? \nUW accepts credits from regionally accredited two-year institutions. Courses are reviewed individually, and some may transfer as direct equivalents to UW courses, general electives, or USP credits. However, vocational-technical and developmental courses typically do not transfer. Students can also petition for USP credit consideration.\nDo four-year college credits transfer to UW? \nYes! Credits from regionally accredited four-year institutions are reviewed on a course-by-course basis. Lower-division courses may transfer as direct equivalents, general electives, or USP credits. Upper-division courses are initially given elective credit, but department faculty can determine if they fulfill major requirements.\nCan I transfer international college credits? \nYes, but international transcripts require additional steps. If your school’s catalog is not online, you must provide course descriptions and/or syllabi for faculty review. If documents are not in English, a certified translation is required. UW’s Admissions Office will conduct an initial review before sending courses to faculty for evaluation.\nWhat about credits from trade or technical schools? \nUW only accepts credit from regionally accredited institutions. If your school meets this standard, eligible coursework will be reviewed individually. Vocational-technical or developmental courses generally do not transfer.\nHow does UW handle quarter system vs. semester system credits? \nUW follows national credit conversion standards. Since quarter-system credits are worth 2/3 of semester credits, a three-course sequence in a quarter system may only equal two semester courses at UW.\nCan I receive credit for military training? \nYes! UW reviews American Council on Education (ACE) military transcripts and may grant credit for formal training courses related to UW subjects. However, credit is not awarded for on-the-job training or short courses. Accredited military schools like service academies, the Defense Language Institute, or the Community College of the Air Force are reviewed like any other college.\n## Contact Us\n### UW Office of Admissions\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 150\n  * 1000 E.
