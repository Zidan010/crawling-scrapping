Besides the stipend, the University of Wyoming waives tuition and fees for all graduate assistantships, depending on the amount of the assistantship awarded. \nTeaching assistantships (TAs) involve teaching-related activities such as a teaching assistant, laboratory assistant, and/or grader. International students are required to pass the English oral proficiency exam (OPI) before they can be awarded a TA.\nAnother source of financial aid comes through research assistantships (RAs). These positions are funded by research grants awarded to and administered by faculty. Students should contact faculty directly to be considered for RA positions.\nAdditionally, occasionally hourly employment as a laboratory assistant or as a grader is sometimes available, although such positions do not carry a tuition waiver.\n**Time Limits for GA Support:**\nA Master's student will only be allowed two years of state-funded support, even if they only received four semesters of half GA support during that time. A Doctoral student can only receive five years post Bachelors (even if they are only at half support). \n**For more information email:**\n  * Dr. Suresh Muknahallipatna, Graduate Coordinator for Electrical Engineering (\n  * Dr. John Hitchcock, Graduate Coordinator for Computer Science (\n\n\n### International Student Information\nInternational Students Services (ISS): \nIn order for international students to receive an I-20 or DS-2019 document it will be necessary for them to document to UW and to a consular official at a U.S. embassy or consulate that they can meet these costs for at least their first year of study in the United States.\nAs part of the admissions process it will be necessary to complete a Confidential Financial Statement document before final admission is granted. This is a standard process at institutions throughout the country. Cost of attendance is a key factor in considering which school to attend in the United States. Many schools are very expensive and the individual must have financial resources for their entire educational experience in the United States.\nInternational students are required to have health insurance (it is available through the University). Other expenses will include housing, food, and textbooks.\n[Learn More About ISS](https://www.uwyo.edu/iss/)\n## BS/MS Quickstart program (EE & COSC)\nStudents are eligible to apply to the MS Quickstart program in the second semester of their Junior year.

To qualify for aid, you must do and/or meet the following requirements:\n  * Apply for [admission to UW](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/apply.html) and [confirm your enrollment](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/nextsteps.html) by paying your enrollment deposit by the posted deadline. This will allow you to be considered for most institutional scholarships or Commitments without having to submit an additional application.\n  * Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year at _does not_ lock anyone into enrolling in college or taking on student debt.\n  * Be a U.S. citizen or eligible [institutional scholarships](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/international/index.html) available for international students.\n  * Have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent. This includes a [home school credit evaluation](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/_files/docs/homeschoolcreditevaluation.pdf) or a General Educational Development (GED) certificate.\n  * Take either the ACT or SAT standardized test. A test-optional preference is available for institutional scholarships or Commitments, but a standardized test score may help boost your eligibility.  _A standardized test score is still a requirement for Wyoming high school graduates to be considered for the Hathaway Scholarship_.\n  * Be enrolled at UW in a degree-seeking program.\n  * Be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours (half-time enrollment) for federal aid as an undergraduate. Notes: Graduate students need to be enrolled in at least 4.5 credit hours to qualify.\n  * Be enrolled in at least 12 credit hours for scholarships or Commitments when an undergraduate. \n  * Do not have federal loans in excess of the annual or aggregate limits of the federal aid program.\n  * Do not have reached your LEU (lifetime eligibility used) for the Pell Grant.\n  * Do not be in default on any federal student loan(s) or owe money on a federal grant.\n  * All continuing students receiving federal aid must be making [satisfactory academic progress](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/sap/index.html) (SAP) towards a degree.\n\n\n* * *\nWhat is the FAFSA?\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the form that allows our office to determine a student's eligibility for several types of financial aid including:\n  * Federal Pell Grant\n  * Federal SEOG Grant\n  * Federal Work-Study Program\n  * State-funded Hathaway need-based scholarship\n  * Institutionally-funded grants\n  * Federal Direct Subsidized Loan\n  * Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan\n  * Federal Parent PLUS Loan\n\n\n**Who should complete the FAFSA?** Although not required, all students should consider completing and submitting a FAFSA each year, even if you think you won't qualify for financial aid, so you don't leave any money on the table. Completing the FAFSA does not lock anyone into enrolling in college or taking on student debt, but it does ensure that you make a major life decision with full knowledge of the money you're entitled to! A basic assumption the federal government makes, when determining federal aid eligibility, is that parents of dependent students - as well as the student, themselves - have the primary responsibility to pay for their education. Submitting the FAFSA does not obligate parents to pay for college, but it does require a parent to provide financial information in order to fully determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. Dependent students who do not qualify grants or Work-Study are usually eligible to borrow a federal student loan to help pay for their education.\n**How do you determine your dependency status for the FAFSA?** Your dependency status determines whether your parents' information will be required or not for the completion of the FAFSA. If you are a dependent student, it doesn't mean your parents are required to pay for your education, but the information is used to determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Your answers to \n**How often do you complete the FAFSA?** The FAFSA needs to be completed each year because it uses a new tax year each time. The form is open for 21 months each cycle, so it uses the \"prior-prior\" tax year. The FAFSA normally opens on October 1 each year, and students must complete it by the earlier of June 30 of that  _academic year_ or their last day of their enrollment in the academic year. For example, a new first-time student starting in the fall could complete the FAFSA beginning the October of their senior year in high school, and they have until June 30 following their first year in college.\n**What happens after you submit the FAFSA?** After your FAFSA has been submitted and processed, a FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) will be created. If you provided a valid email address when completing the FAFSA, you will receive an email with instructions to access the FSS online. If your FAFSA didn't have a valid email address, you will receive a paper FSS in the mail. The FSS will indicate if there are actions required or if the FAFSA is complete. Additionally, it will:\n  * summarize the information you and your contributors included on the FAFSA,\n  * provide estimated eligibility for federal student loans and grants,\n  * and provide the calculated Student Aid Index (SAI) which is a number calculated by the Department of Education based upon your FAFSA components such as income and assets. Our office uses the SAI to determine how much federal aid and need-based aid you qualify for. It is intended to represent your family's financial strength and ability to pay for college.\n\n\n**What about mistakes on the FAFSA?** If you find a mistake when reviewing your FSS, you will need to login to [Federal Student Aid website](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/v/apply-for-aid/fafsa/review-and-correct/fafsa-submission-summary).\n* * *\nHow to Apply for Aid\nStudents will be evaluated for merit scholarships through the application process at the University of Wyoming. If you want to be considered for federal financial aid, as well as any need-based aid (federal, state, or institutional), you will need to complete the FAFSA (Steps 1 and 2 below).\nStep 1 - Create FSA ID\nCreate a Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) on \nStep 2 - Submit FAFSA\nComplete and submit the FAFSA online. **UW's school code is 003932** ; if you do not include it on your FAFSA, UW will not receive your FAFSA information and cannot process your FAFSA.\nSince the FAFSA uses a new tax year each year, you and your FAFSA contributors should plan on submitting the form annually for each new academic year.\nStudents complete the Student section of the FAFSA and they invite contributors to complete their section(s). The student and contributors will be required to provide consent to have their federal tax information released from the IRS, even if a tax return was not filed. After all contributors have consented and signed the form, it will be submitted for processing. For online FAFSA submissions, a confirmation will be sent at the time confirming successful submission.\nAfter submission, your FAFSA typically takes 2-3 business days to process. Be sure to log back into your account on \n_FAFSA Hints:_\n  * _When creating your FSA ID, make sure your email address is entered correctly._\n  * _Be sure your social security number is also entered accurately before submitting the FAFSA. This is used by the U.S. Department of Education and UW to match and process your FAFSA. Entering it incorrectly will result in an error that can cause significant delays._\n  * _To determine who needs to be a contributor on your FAFSA, use this_\n  * _The FAFSA asks about family size. Your response should include individuals who meet specific support and relationship criteria for the award year_\n  * _When completing the income section, if a question does not apply to you (or your contributor), enter a zero (0). Leaving questions blank can result in processing delays._\n  * _For asset information, not all students (or your contributor[s]) are required to report assets on the FAFSA. The application will guide you based on your situation and your previous answers. If you don't have any assets to report and the questions don't not apply to you, enter a zero (0). Leaving questions blank can result in processing delays._\n  * _Before you submit your FAFSA, be sure to carefully look over the review page that summarizes all your responses. If you notice any mistakes, correcting them before submitting the form is always the preferred practice._\n\n\nStep 3 - Access WyoScholarships\nComplete the General Application in \nAfter completing the General Application in WyoScholarships, you can review any recommended scholarships requiring applications if you meet the criteria. If you have been awarded a Commitment, any scholarship that you apply for, and receive, will usually help fulfill the Commitment amount.\nStep 4 - Review Requirements and Submit Documentation\nNavigate to [WyoWeb](https://wyoweb.uwyo.edu/) and login to WyoRecords using the 'Students' link and review your Checklist for the current aid year _Requirements_. Monitor your UWYO email and Checklist regularly for notifications from our office. There may be requirements you need to satisfy or documents you need to submit to our office to verify data before we can provide your financial aid package. That includes any students who have been selected for [FAFSA verification](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html).\nIf you have submitted a FAFSA, there will be three requirements for Title IV (federal) aid to complete on your Checklist. The intent of each requirement is based upon if a student might ever have more federal financial aid than they have charges in any given semester. These can be a little tricky, so the table below will provide our suggestions.\n**Title IV Charges Authorization** | **Prior Year Charges Authorization** | **Hold Title IV Credit Balances Authorization**  \n---|---|---  \n**If you ACCEPT:** Non-standard  _current year charges_ will be paid for with any excess federal financial aid. |  **If you ACCEPT:** Non-standards  _prior year charges_ will be paid with excess federal financial aid for the current aid year. |  **If you ACCEPT:** Excess federal financial aid will be held by UW for charges in a future semester. Excess monies will finally be refunded to you towards the end of spring semester of that aid year.  \n**If you DECLINE:** Those charges will remain on your student account and must be paid. |  **If you DECLINE:**  _Prior year charges_ will remain on your account and must be paid. |  **If you DECLINE:** You will control any excess aid amount yourself and can choose to apply it to charges in a future semester.  \nYou only have to submit your preferences for these authorizations once as a student, but you can go back and adjust them anytime and then resubmit.\nWhat to do Next?\n**Monitor your email** - Our office will notify you by email (your UWYO email account) about the status of your financial aid throughout your time at UW.\n**Submit required documents** - If notify you that you have been selected for [FAFSA verification](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/verification/index.html), be sure to submit all requested documentation as soon as possible so the disbursement of your financial aid isn't negatively impacted.\n**Review aid package** - Once you have been packaged with financial aid offers, you will receive an email from our office. Log into [WyoWeb > WyoRecords > 'Students link'](https://wyoweb.uwyo.edu/) to access your Checklist for the current aid year _Awards._ Beginning each March, you will be able to accept or decline federal student loan offers and/or Work-Study awards (if eligible) that you have received for the upcoming academic year. Note: Federal Pell Grants and SEOG Grants are loaded as 'accepted', so no further action is required.\n**Complete donor thank you letters** - Although students no longer need to accept the scholarship that fulfill their Commitments, we still encourage you to watch for email prompts from \n[Return to Top of Page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/applying-for-financial-aid/index.html#top-of-page)\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

This Commitment is a merit-based financial pledge determined by a student's cumulative unweighted* high school GPA and composite test scores** (ACT or SAT), and it has four levels of support paid annually: $6,500, $4,000, $2,000, or $1,000.\nStudents must be degree-seeking through UW's Laramie or Casper campuses. UW Online students are not eligible for these scholarships.\nThe Cowboy Commitment is offered as a placeholder and will be funded annually with individual scholarships that are made possible through the generosity of UW Foundation donors and/or other institutional aid. Funding of this Commitment is contingent on the annual completion of the general application and any applicable recommended applications within \nThe Cowboy Commitment normally cannot be combined with any other institutional scholarship aid, including those made possible by the UW Foundation.\nTransfer Students: New first-time transfer students from Wyoming will be considered for the [WY Transfer Commitment](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/transfers/resident-transfer-student-commitment.html) as they do not qualify for the Cowboy Commitment.\n**Please note** : All University of Wyoming financial awards are only available to eligible admits.

Additionally, students must also complete UW's Hathaway Eligibility Verification Form that will be found on your checklist in WyoRecords.\nQualifying for a Hathaway Scholarship does not automatically qualify a student for admission to UW. Please see the UW Admissions website for admission requirements.\n***IMPORTANT!** Based on Wyoming Hathaway Legislation, ACT or SAT test scores are still required to determine eligibility for the Hathaway Scholarship. The ACT Superscore can be used.\n## Receiving Scholarship Funds\nScholarship Initiation\nEligible students must initiate the Hathaway Scholarship at UW or a Wyoming community college within a certain time frame as follows:\n  * Four (4) years of graduating high school or HSEC, or\n  * By their 21st birthday for home school graduates\n\n\nOnce the scholarship has been initiated, students have up to six (6) years to receive the full scholarship benefit: 8 full-time semesters or the equivalent of 96 credit hours.\nDeferring the Scholarship\nStudents can defer the scholarship only for full-time religious or military service, and documentation must be provided of the deferring event. Incoming students to UW must complete [Admissions' deferral form](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/defer-enrollment.html). Continuing students need to communicate directly with our office regarding the deferral request.\nEnrollment Status\nStudents can receive the Hathaway Scholarship as part-time students; however, they must be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours to qualify. For enrollment of 6-11 credit hours in a semester, the award will be pro-rated as shown in the table below. Additionally, if a student qualifies for the Hathaway Need-Based Scholarship (see the next section below), that will also be pro-rated for part-time students based upon their number of credit hours.\n|  **Honors Level** **$ per Semester** |  **Performance Level** **$ per Semester** |  **Opportunity or Provisional Level** **$ per Semester**  \n---|---|---|---  \n12 or more credit hours | $1,680 | $1,260 | $840  \n11 credit hours | $1,540 | $1,155 | $770  \n10 credit hours | $1,400 | $1,050 | $700  \n9 credit hours | $1,260 | $945 | $630  \n8 credit hours | $1,120 | $840 | $560  \n7 credit hours | $980 | $735 | $490  \n6 credit hours | $840 | $630 | $420  \n1-5 credit hours | not eligible | not eligible | not eligible  \n[Return to Top of Page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/index.html#hathaway-page)\n## Need-Based Scholarship Requirements\nStudents who qualify for the Hathaway Scholarship, and who have completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), may qualify for an additional Hathaway Need-Based Scholarship if they have unmet financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Unmet need is calculated as follows:\nUW [Cost of Attendance](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/cost-of-attendance/index.html) (COA)\nLESS Student Aid Index (SAI)* as determined by FAFSA\nLESS Hathaway Scholarship amount\nLESS sum of Grants and other Scholarships, including external scholarships\nLESS $2,000 student commitment required by Wyoming Hathaway Legislation\nEQUALS Unmet Need\n*A negative SAI will be considered zero (0) for the purposes of this unmet need calculation\nQualifying students will receive a percentage of this unmet need based upon their level of Hathaway Scholarship:\n  * **Performance, Opportunity, or Provisional Levels** : 25% of unmet need. The minimum offered amount will be $105 per semester or a maximum of $787.50 per semester.\n  * **Honors Level** : 100% of unmet need\n\n\n**IMPORTANT!** Student must be eligible for Hathaway Scholarship in order to qualify to receive a Hathaway Need-Based Scholarship in any semester or academic year.\n## Renewing REquirements\nAfter initiating the Hathaway Scholarship, students must maintain three standards to continue receiving the scholarship. These are requirements are reviewed following each spring semester at UW.\n  * Minimum GPA Standard\n  * Minimum Credit Hour Standard\n  * Continuous Enrollment Standard\n\n\nMore details can be found on our Renew Your Financial Aid page.\n[Renew Your Financial Aid](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/index.html)\n## Regaining the Scholarship\nThe Hathaway Scholarship can be regained if you lose the scholarship for not maintaining the renewing standards. The requirements are dependent upon your enrollment status when you last received Hathaway funds, and you should always self-identify to our office when you feel you are meeting those standards again.\nMore information can be found on our Renew Your Financial Aid page.\n[Renew Your Financial Aid](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/index.html)\n[Return to Top of Page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/index.html#hathaway-page)\n## Transferring the Scholarship\nStudents who transfer between Wyoming institutions after initiating the scholarship will need to transfer their Hathaway Scholarship by requesting their Hathaway Transfer Transcript. This transcript is different than your official transcript from a registrar's office, and it cannot be created or sent until all grades are posted from the last semester of attendance. The Hathaway Transfer Transcript allows us to determine your ongoing eligibility to receive the scholarship at UW.\nTransfer students who never initiated the Hathaway Scholarship at any Wyoming institution, but who are still within the four years of graduating high school*, will need to have their official high school transcript sent to UW Admissions, as well as their standardized test scores, so we can determine your initial eligibility.\nAll Transfer students must complete UW's Hathaway Eligibility Verification Form that will be found on your checklist in WyoRecords.\nHow to request your Hathaway Transfer Transcript\n**Casper College** : \n**Central Wyoming College** : Contact Kathryn DeWitt (\n**Eastern Wyoming College** : \n**Gillette and Sheridan Colleges** : \n**Laramie County Community College** : \n**Northwest College** : Contact Maureen Walsh (\n**University of Wyoming** : Contact the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid (\n**Western Wyoming Community College** : Contact the Financial Aid office (\n## History of The Scholarship\nThe Hathaway Scholarship has its roots in Governor Stanley Hathaway's 1974 decision to create the state of Wyoming Permanent Mineral Trust Fund. The fund's income would support state government operations - including higher education in Wyoming. In 2005, state lawmakers created a scholarship fund with a $400 million permanent endowment, whose income funds scholarships for qualified students to attend the University of Wyoming or any of the state's community colleges.\nThey honored his many contributions to the state and accomplishments by naming the scholarship program for Governor Hathaway.\n[Return to Top of Page](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/hathaway/index.html#hathaway-page)\n## Contact Us\n### Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid\nKnight Hall\n  * Room 174\n  * 1000 E.

The Scholarship Committee will review the admission application, high school curriculum, unweighted high school GPA, and ACT/SAT scores to select candidates moving onto the second round of the selection process.\nThose students moving to the second round of the selection process will be notified via email.\nInterviews and Selection Period\nStudents who make it to the second round will be notified and invited in December to submit the following:\n  * Essay\n  * Resumé\n  * Name and contact information for a high school administrator (Principal or Assistant Principal) or high school counselor to certify good standing\n\n\nThe due date for the second round submission is December 17, 2025.\nThe Scholarship Committee will review items submitted to determine who will advance to the final round of the selection process. Students selected to move onto the final round will be invited to participate in an online interview open January 8 through January 20, 2026.\n  * _In response to thoughtful feedback from Wyoming families and with the goal of making the process more accessible, the University of Wyoming will no longer require an in-person interview as part of the Trustees’ Scholars Award selection. This change is intended to reduce travel and scheduling burdens, while ensuring that all qualified students may be considered for the University’s most prestigious scholarship. Our commitment remains the same—to recognize and support Wyoming’s top scholars._\n\n\nNotification Period\nStudents who are awarded the Trustees' Scholars Award will be notified in mid-February.\nBy May 1, 2026, 11:59 pm (Mountain Daylight Time) they must\n  * accept their award and the Terms & Conditions in WyoScholarships, AND\n  * complete all steps to [confirm their enrollment](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/nextsteps.html#confirm) at UW.\n\n\nImportant INformation for Trustees' Scholars Award Recipients\nThis scholarship works in combination with the Cowboy Commitment and Hathaway Honors Scholarship to cover up to four years (eight semesters) toward your first bachelor’s degree, including:\n  * Tuition (up to 18 credits/semester)\n  * Mandatory fees\n  * Standard double room and meal plan (when living in university housing)\n\n\nStudents selected to receive the Trustees' Scholars Award must accept their award and the Terms and Conditions in WyoScholarships AND confirm their enrollment at UW by May 1, 2026 11:59 pm (Mountain Daylight Time).\nStudents must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher at the end of each academic year with continuous enrollment of 12 hours each fall and spring semester, with successful completion of 24 credit hours each academic year.\nFor information on maintaining the Trustees' Scholars Award, see [Renew Your Financial Aid](https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/renew-your-financial-aid/index.html) or contact the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid with questions.\n* * *\nQuestions?\nUW is committed to recruiting and retaining the top students from across Wyoming.
