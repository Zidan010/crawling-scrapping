#  Programs in  Accounting 
#### **Utilize problem-solving and analytical skills that steer businesses toward financial success and help individuals make better decisions today.**
Accountants record the data and processes of the business so that an accurate picture of the business is available and better decisions can be made. We offer an undergraduate accounting curriculum that covers financial accounting, financial reporting, managerial/cost accounting, tax, audit, forensic accounting, and accounting information systems.
Our Master of Accountancy (MAcc), a STEM-designated program, prepares students for eligibility to become certified public accountants. Different paths are available for students who wish to apply for the MAcc, depending on their exposure to accounting classes as an undergraduate.
##  100% Placement Rate for Accounting Majors

## Professional Opportunities
From analysis to reporting, we prepare students to excel in accounting roles for various organizations, from public firms to government agencies. Our programs will equip you with critical thinking, problem-solving, and cross-functional management skills pivotal for fighting white-collar crime, steering businesses toward financial success, and helping individuals make smart decisions with their money. UTulsa alumni thrive as leaders in this field, enjoying employment at powerhouses such as Amazon, ConocoPhillips, and Deloitte.
**Job opportunities:**
  * Bank officer
  * Financial analyst
  * Auditor and tax accountant
  * Commodities trader
  * Public accountant


> The biggest misconception is that accounting is math. It isn’t. Accounting is a language - the language of recording a business’s history through its financial transactions. What you learn when getting an accounting degree is the vocabulary and rules of that language.
> Hannah Bostian _(BA '19)_
## Beyond the Classroom
  * EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
  * Beta Alpha Psi
  * SOCIAL JUSTICE & SERVICE
  * JOB PLACEMENT


  * ## Build skills and networks through internships.
Accounting internships provide practical experience in areas like auditing, tax preparation, financial reporting, and consulting. Students gain valuable exposure to real-world accounting practices, working with accounting software, analyzing financial data, and supporting regulatory compliance efforts. Offered by public accounting firms, corporations, and government agencies, these internships often lead to full-time employment and help students build essential skills and professional networks.
[ Find internships](https://utulsa.edu/student-life/canecareers/students-alumni/finding-job-internship/)
  * ## Be part of something bigger.
Beta Alpha Psi is an international honor society for students majoring in accounting, finance, and information systems. At UTulsa, the organization provides networking and service opportunities to our students. The chapter hosts guest speakers, an annual career fair, and an annual alumni trivia competition. Additionally, students have opportunities to partner with local employers on community service projects and provide mentorship and tutoring to other business students.
  * ## Be the change you want to see.
UTulsa encourages students to give back to the community and see societal problems through a different lens. In considering issues ranging from low-income to racial biases, students analyze the intricacies of cyclical social issues to gain broader perspectives and insights, which they can share with others and act on in the community.
[ CIVIC ENGAGEMENT](https://utulsa.edu/student-life/civic-engagement/)
  * ## Pursue success with confidence - backed by UTulsa's job placement guarantee.
UTulsa is committed to our students’ professional success, which is why our Center for Career Development, aka CaneCareers, offers a job placement guarantee program. We promise that students who follow the program will land an entry-level job in their chosen field or continue their education within six months of graduation, or we’ll give them a free semester of grad school.
