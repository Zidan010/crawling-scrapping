Students are encouraged to bring their curiosity and sense of discovery to each course and research project.\nAs a computer scientist at UW, you’ll gain a deep knowledge of the theory and practice of computing — an essential skill in today's modern world. Whether you’re pursuing a master’s degree in computer science or a Ph.D. in computer science, you’ll leave UW prepared to advance the computing industry’s principles and practices.\n[ Request Info ](https://www.uwyo.edu/admissions/request-information/index.html)\nThis program is currently offered in   \nthe following locations: \nLaramie Campus\n## About the Ph.D. and Master's Degree in Computer Science\n###  Program Overview \nUW’s computer science graduate programs give students the opportunity to learn from accomplished professors in small group settings. Our faculty conduct research in a wide variety of areas, including computational complexity, distributed computing, formal verification and theorem proving, artificial intelligence, computer vision, virtual reality and cybersecurity.  \n  \nOur goal as a department is to help students gain hands-on experience. That’s why all computer science students have access to state-of-the-art equipment, conferences and workshops. We additionally partner with companies and research institutions to provide students with internships. The majority of our graduate students receive stipends that cover tuition costs and living expenses.\n###  Admission Requirements \n**Applicants for a graduate degree in computer science are expected to have completed undergraduate courses in:**\n  * Algorithms and Data Structures (COSC 3020 equivalent)\n  * Theory of Computing (COSC 4100 or 4200 equivalent)\n  * Operating Systems (COSC 4740 equivalent)\n  * Programming Languages or Compilers (COSC 4780 or 4785 equivalent)\n\n\n  \n**Applicants to the Ph.D. in computer science must have completed a bachelor's degree in computer science or a closely related discipline at an accredited university or college.**  \n  \n**The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is encouraged but not required.**\n  * GRE scores should be a minimum of 40th percentile for the verbal score and 65th percentile for the quantitative score. Our strongest students tend to have scores substantially above these minimums, with quantitative scores often around the 90th percentile or higher.  \n  \n\n\n\n**Students whose native language is not English must also complete the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with scores of at least:**\n  * 550 on the paper based TOEFL\n  * 213 on the computerized test, including a 58 or better in Reading Test 1\n  * 80 for the internet based TOEFL (iBT), including a score of 23 or better in Reading Test 1\n\n\n  \n**Alternatively, students may take the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) test. They must score 6.5 or better.**  \n  \n**Applicants must submit contact information for three references who can evaluate their potential for graduate study in computer science. If you wish to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science, the reference letters should address your ability to pursue quality original research. Letters should also evaluate your oral and written communication skills.**  \n  \n**If you meet the minimum criteria and would like to formally apply for admission you will also need to submit the following information during the completion of your application via the application portal:**\n  * Copies of your transcripts from all colleges and universities for all degrees attained. You must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 out of 4.0 or equivalent.  \n\n    * International applicants must submit copies of individual semester transcripts. Consolidated transcripts will not be accepted.  \nGRE scores \n  * Contact information for three recommendation letters  \n\n    * Applicants should follow up with recommenders to ensure this requirement is fulfilled. Applications will not be processed further until all recommendations have been received.\n  * International students will also need to submit a copy of TOEFL scores or IELTS scores.\n\n\n###  Courses & Curriculum \nOur master's program covers essential topics such as Analysis of Algorithms, AI, ML, Cybersecurity and HCI, equipping students with the skills needed for various professional pathways. For those aiming for higher academic pursuits, our Ph.D. program delves deeper into computing principles and practices, with specialized focuses including AI, Complexity & Information Theory, Human-Computer Interaction, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Distributed Computing.
